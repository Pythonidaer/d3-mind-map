  introduction: `Storybook is not just a development tool â€” it's a multifunctional environment designed to support the full lifecycle of UI components. Its primary use cases include isolated component development, living documentation, visual testing, and interactive demos. Each use case addresses key pain points in modern frontend workflows and makes Storybook a central hub for UI development.`,

  conclusion: `Storybook excels in four critical areas of modern frontend development: isolated component creation, automatic documentation, visual regression testing, and interactive demos. These use cases unlock faster workflows, greater team visibility, and higher component quality. Whether you're debugging a component in isolation or presenting a live demo to stakeholders, Storybook ensures that every piece of UI is reliable, reusable, and well-documented. Embracing these use cases turns Storybook from a dev tool into a shared source of truth for the entire team.`,
