  introduction: `Storybook is built around a few fundamental ideas that enable developers to create, view, and test UI components in isolation. These core concepts — Stories, Component Story Format (CSF), Args, and Addons — form the basis of how Storybook functions and why it’s so widely adopted in modern frontend workflows.`,

      code: `// Storybook automatically creates controls for these args
  export const WithControls = {

      title: 'Example of Custom Addon Use',
      code: `// .storybook/main.js
  module.exports = {
    addons: ['@storybook/addon-controls', '@storybook/addon-actions'],
  };`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Understanding these foundational elements of Storybook enables frontend teams to take full advantage of its powerful features. From defining structured stories using CSF, to enabling real-time prop editing with Args and Controls, to extending capabilities via Addons, these concepts lay the groundwork for a modular, maintainable, and interactive UI development process. Mastering them ensures that Storybook becomes a productive and collaborative tool within any frontend workflow.`,
