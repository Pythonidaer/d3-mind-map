  introduction: `Integrating Storybook into your frontend development workflow enables more isolated, testable, and documented UI component development. This typical workflow outlines the key steps teams follow—from writing the component, defining stories, using addons, to deploying a live component catalog.`,

    content: [
      'Requires discipline to keep stories updated as components evolve.',
      'Can become disorganized without a consistent folder and naming convention.',
      'Static deployment adds maintenance overhead if hosted separately from main app.',
    ],

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
    content: [
      'Skipping stories for "simple" components—leads to gaps in documentation.',
      'Overcomplicating stories with logic unrelated to component behavior.',
      'Ignoring local testing—relying solely on visual inspection after deployment.',

      title: 'Storybook Startup Script',
      code: `// package.json

    component: Button,
  };
  
  export const Primary = {
    args: {
      label: 'Submit',

      title: 'Running Storybook Locally',
      code: `# In your terminal
  npm run storybook
  
  # Open http://localhost:6006 in your browser`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Deploying to Netlify',
      code: `# Build static files
  npm run build-storybook
  
  # Deploy the storybook-static/ folder to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `A typical Storybook workflow empowers frontend teams to build modular, documented, and testable components efficiently. By working in isolation and leveraging addons for enhanced functionality, developers can produce higher quality UIs while keeping stakeholders in the loop through live previews and static deployment. This workflow not only boosts productivity but also ensures UI consistency and clarity across an application’s lifespan.`,
