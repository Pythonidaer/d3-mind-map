  conclusion: `Storybook empowers frontend teams by combining visual testing, interactive exploration, documentation, and modular design into one cohesive workflow. Its ability to catch regressions, clarify design intentions, and foster team-wide visibility makes it far more than a developer tool—it becomes the UI command center. Whether you're onboarding a new hire, testing edge cases, or showcasing components to stakeholders, Storybook ensures consistency, quality, and speed across the board.`,
