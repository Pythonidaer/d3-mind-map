  introduction: `Evidence-based learning strategies are backed by decades of cognitive science research. Unlike intuitive or traditional study habits (such as rereading or highlighting), these strategies actively strengthen memory, improve understanding, and accelerate skill development. By aligning how we study with how our brains actually encode and retrieve information, learners achieve deeper, longer-lasting mastery.`,

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Scientifically Validated Techniques',
    content: [
      '**Retrieval Practice:** The act of trying to recall information from memory, such as answering a question without looking at notes. It improves memory more effectively than review alone.',
      '**Spaced Repetition:** Reviewing material over gradually expanding intervals. This interrupts forgetting and strengthens long-term memory formation.',
      '**Interleaving:** Alternating between different topics or types of problems rather than blocking by category. This creates desirable difficulty that improves concept application.',
      "**Elaboration:** Asking 'how' and 'why' questions, relating material to prior knowledge, or rephrasing it in your own words. These techniques deepen semantic memory.",
      '**Dual Coding:** Pairing words with visuals (e.g., diagrams, timelines, charts) helps create two cognitive pathways to the same information, enhancing retrieval.',
      '**Concrete Examples:** Using specific examples helps learners grasp abstract ideas and apply them to new situations.',
      '**Metacognition:** Thinking about what you know and don’t know. Reflecting on learning progress helps guide strategy selection and improves retention.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      'Enhances long-term retention and recall accuracy.',
      'Increases comprehension and ability to apply knowledge in new contexts.',
      'Reduces overconfidence by making gaps in knowledge more visible.',
      'Encourages active engagement and attention during study.',
      'Improves test performance, project readiness, and deep transfer.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Cons',
    content: [
      'More effortful than passive review—can feel harder initially.',
      'Requires planning and intention to implement consistently.',
      'Some strategies (e.g., interleaving) feel less fluent even though they work better.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Passive Review:** Simply rereading or highlighting without recall or testing, which produces a weak memory trace.',
      '**Illusion of Mastery:** Feeling confident due to familiarity, not because the material can be recalled or used accurately.',
      '**Surface-Level Elaboration:** Making shallow or vague connections instead of specific, meaningful associations.',
    ],
  },

  examples: {
    title: 'Practical Use Cases',
    content: [
      '**Flashcard Testing:** Instead of flipping flashcards until they feel familiar, quiz yourself on them actively and write your answer first.',
      '**Daily Spaced Reviews:** Use apps like Anki to resurface challenging content at optimal intervals for reinforcement.',
      '**Interleaved Math Practice:** Mix algebra, geometry, and statistics questions rather than practicing them in separate blocks.',
      '**Teach Back:** After learning something new, explain it to someone else (or a rubber duck) to practice elaboration and metacognition.',
      '**Diagram + Text Summaries:** Create a chart or flow diagram alongside your notes to dual-code new concepts.',
      '**Error Reflection Journal:** After quizzes or projects, list what went wrong and what strategy you’ll use next time.',
    ],
  },

  terms: {
    title: 'Key Terms and Concepts',
    content: [
      '**Retrieval Practice:** Testing yourself without access to notes to strengthen memory.',
      '**Spaced Repetition:** Reviewing content at planned intervals to reinforce learning.',
      '**Interleaving:** Mixing related topics during study to improve flexible understanding.',
      '**Elaboration:** Explaining ideas in your own words and making deep connections.',
      '**Dual Coding:** Using both visuals and text to learn a concept.',
      '**Concrete Examples:** Grounding an abstract concept in a real, relatable scenario.',
      '**Metacognition:** Monitoring and reflecting on your own learning process.',
      '**4±1 Rule:** The average number of items that can be held in working memory. These strategies help overcome that limit.',
    ],
  },

  conclusion: `Evidence-based strategies offer a powerful alternative to traditional study habits. By embracing effortful, research-backed methods like retrieval, spacing, and elaboration, learners build mastery that lasts. These tools are especially effective when used together—and with intention—to make learning efficient, meaningful, and resilient.`,
