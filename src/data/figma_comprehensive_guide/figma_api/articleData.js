    introduction: `The Figma API unlocks programmatic access to your design files and extends Figma’s capabilities beyond the editor. By mastering both the REST API and the in-app Plugin API—while handling authentication, rate limits, SDKs, and webhooks—frontend engineers can automate workflows, integrate design data into development pipelines, and build custom tools that bridge the gap between design and code.`,
  
    keyPrinciples: {
      title: 'Key Principles of the Figma API',
      content: [
        `**REST API**: Use HTTP endpoints to fetch document structure, export assets, and manage comments—empowering you to integrate design data into CI/CD, style guides, or automated testing pipelines.`,
        `**Plugin API**: Leverage in-app JavaScript APIs to create custom UI panels, manipulate nodes, and persist settings—enabling bespoke tooling and enhancements directly inside Figma.`,
        `**Auth & Rate Limits**: Secure your integrations with personal access tokens or OAuth2, and implement respectful back-off logic to stay within usage quotas and avoid service interruptions.`,
        `**SDKs & Tools**: Adopt official and community SDKs (TypeScript, Python, Ruby) or CLI utilities to streamline API calls, handle data transformations, and generate assets or tokens programmatically.`,
        `**Webhooks & Integrations**: Subscribe to file or comment events to trigger automated workflows—such as design-token sync, asset pipelines, or inspection alerts—ensuring your toolchain stays in sync with design changes.`
      ]
    },
  
    benefits: {
      title: 'Benefits for Frontend Engineers',
      content: [
        `**Workflow Automation**: Automatically export design tokens, images, and component metadata without manual intervention, reducing repetitive tasks and errors.`,
        `**Seamless Integration**: Incorporate design data into build processes, style dictionaries, or documentation sites by pulling file content via the API.`,
        `**Custom Tooling**: Build Figma plugins for in-editor utilities—like batch renaming layers or validating design rules—tailored to your project’s requirements.`,
        `**Real-Time Updates**: Use webhooks to react instantly to design changes, keeping your development environment, documentation, and QA pipelines aligned with the latest assets.`,
        `**Scalable Solutions**: Handle large files and multiple projects programmatically, enabling enterprise-grade automation and consistency across design systems.`
      ]
    },
  
    cons: {
      title: 'Challenges & Considerations',
      content: [
        `**API Complexity**: The REST API surfaces a vast JSON structure; parsing and mapping that data into meaningful application models can be non-trivial.`,
        `**Rate Limiting**: Heavy or unthrottled requests quickly hit usage quotas, requiring robust retry and back-off strategies to avoid 429 errors.`,
        `**Maintenance Overhead**: Managing access tokens securely, rotating credentials, and staying up-to-date with API changes demands ongoing effort.`,
        `**Performance Costs**: Exporting large images or traversing deep document hierarchies can be time-consuming; optimizing requests and caching results is essential.`
      ]
    },
  
    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
      content: [
        `**Ignoring API Documentation**: Skipping the official docs leads to misuse of endpoints, inconsistent data handling, and time wasted on trial-and-error.`,
        `**Hardcoding Tokens**: Embedding personal access tokens in source code or logs exposes your projects to unauthorized access and security breaches.`,
        `**Flooding the API**: Failing to respect rate limits by sending bursts of requests can trigger throttling and disrupt dependent workflows.`,
        `**Silent Failures**: Not implementing error handling or logging for API and plugin operations causes hard-to-debug, silent breakages in automated processes.`
      ]
    },
  
    restApi: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: REST API',
      content: [
        `The REST API provides endpoints like **GET /v1/files/:file_key** to retrieve a file’s full document model—including pages, frames, nodes, and component definitions. You can traverse this JSON to extract component names, style metadata, or hierarchical structures for documentation or code generation.`,
        `Use **GET /v1/images/:file_key** to export specific node IDs as PNG, JPG, SVG, or PDF by specifying format parameters and scale options. This automates asset generation for responsive image sets or icon libraries without manual exports.`,
        `The **comments** endpoints (**GET**, **POST**, **DELETE /v1/files/:file_key/comments**) let you programmatically fetch feedback threads or post review notes—integrating design annotations into your issue trackers or QA dashboards.`
      ]
    },
  
    pluginApi: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Plugin API',
      content: [
        `Figma plugins run inside the app with access to the **UI API** (` + '`figma.showUI()`' + `) for custom panels and dialogs. You can build interactive interfaces that query or transform the active document.`,
        `The **Node API** (` + '`figma.currentPage.findAll()`' + `, ` + '`node.x = 100`' + `) allows you to read and modify document nodes—creating frames, updating fills, or exporting selection data—to enforce design rules or generate artifacts.`,
        `Persist data using the **Storage API** (` + '`figma.clientStorage.setAsync()`' + `) to save plugin settings or caches locally or in a shared team library, enabling stateful plugins that remember user preferences or synchronization points.`
      ]
    },
  
    authenticationRateLimits: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Auth & Rate Limits',
      content: [
        `**Personal Access Tokens** are generated in your Figma account settings and grant scoped access to the REST API. Treat them like passwords—store them in environment variables or secret stores and rotate regularly.`,
        `Implement **OAuth2** flows when building applications on behalf of users. This involves redirecting users to Figma’s authorization endpoint, obtaining authorization codes, and exchanging them for access tokens—ensuring user-scoped security and revocation capabilities.`,
        `Respect **Rate Limits** (typically 60 requests per minute per token). Handle HTTP 429 responses by queuing retries with exponential back-off, and batch operations where possible (e.g., fetching multiple node IDs in one request) to minimize API calls.`
      ]
    },
  
    sdksTools: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: SDKs & Tools',
      content: [
        `The official **@figma/js** TypeScript SDK wraps REST endpoints in typed methods, simplifying authentication, request signing, and response parsing—enabling you to write clean, type-safe scripts or serverless functions.`,
        `The **Figma CLI** (e.g., ` + '`figma-export`' + `) offers command-line commands to download assets, export design tokens, or generate JSON schemas from your files—integrating seamlessly into CI workflows or build pipelines.`,
        `Community **Third-Party SDKs** for Python, Ruby, and Go provide idiomatic interfaces to the API—ideal if your backend stack is polyglot. They often include convenience functions for pagination, retries, and data transformation.`
      ]
    },
  
    webhooksIntegrations: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Webhooks & Integrations',
      content: [
        `Figma supports **File Webhooks** to POST payloads to your endpoint whenever a file is updated. Use this to trigger automated processes—like regenerating token files, rebuilding a style guide site, or syncing components into a design-system repo.`,
        `**Comment Webhooks** notify you in real time when comments are created, resolved, or deleted. Integrate these with chat or ticketing systems to keep your team aware of review activity and ensure feedback loops stay tight.`,
        `Combine webhooks with integration examples—such as auto-publishing new assets to a CDN, running visual regression tests on updated frames, or notifying frontend builds to refresh caches—creating a fully automated design-driven pipeline.`
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion: `By mastering both the REST and Plugin APIs—alongside secure authentication, thoughtful rate-limit handling, SDKs, and webhooks—frontend engineers can transform Figma into a programmatic powerhouse. Automating exports, syncing design tokens, and building custom in-editor tools not only accelerates development but also enforces consistency and reliability across your UI implementations.`
