    introduction: `Programmatic and AI-driven generation in Figma empowers teams to create and update designs at scale. By leveraging the REST and Plugin APIs, authoring custom plugins, and adopting AI techniques like text-to-design or image-to-vector, frontend engineers can automate repetitive tasks, prototype rapidly, and maintain consistency across complex design systems.`,

      title: 'Key Principles of Code & AI to Figma Generation',
      content: [
        `**API‐based Scripting**: Use Figma’s REST and Plugin APIs to create frames, layers, and apply Styles programmatically, enabling batch updates and integration with development pipelines.`,
        `**Plugin Authoring**: Build custom in‐app plugins with the Plugin API to automate layer organization, style enforcement, or component generation directly within Figma.`,
        `**Text-to-Design AI**: Craft clear natural-language prompts to guide AI tools in generating layouts, components, and style variations, then refine outputs iteratively.`,
        `**FigJam AI**: Leverage built-in or plugin-powered AI features in FigJam to auto-generate wireframes, diagrams, and meeting templates, streamlining planning and ideation.`,
        `**Image-to-Design AI**: Convert reference images into editable vectors, extract color palettes, and infer layouts, jumpstarting design creation from visual assets.`

    benefits: {
      title: 'Benefits for Frontend Engineers',
      content: [
        `**Scalability**: Automate creation of large design libraries or repetitive patterns, reducing manual workload and error rates.`,
        `**Speed**: Rapidly generate initial layouts or assets from code and AI, accelerating prototyping and design iteration.`,
        `**Consistency**: Enforce style and structural standards through scripts or plugin rules, ensuring uniformity across files.`,
        `**Innovation**: Explore creative variations through AI-driven suggestions, uncovering novel design ideas that might otherwise be missed.`,
        `**Integration**: Seamlessly tie design updates into build processes or CMS pipelines via API scripts or webhooks.`
      ]
    },
  
    cons: {
      title: 'Challenges & Considerations',
      content: [
        `**Complexity**: Writing robust scripts or plugins requires understanding Figma’s node model, asynchronous APIs, and error handling.`,
        `**AI Reliability**: AI outputs can be inconsistent or misaligned with brand guidelines, necessitating human review and refinement.`,
        `**Validation Overhead**: Automatically generated designs must be validated for accessibility, naming conventions, and layout integrity.`,
        `**Security & Privacy**: Exposing design data or tokens to external services for AI prompts or scripts poses risks if not managed securely.`
      ]
    },
  
    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
      content: [
        `**Ignoring Programmatic Methods**: Falling back to manual edits for repetitive tasks leads to inefficiency and mistakes.`,
        `**Unmanaged AI Generation**: Trusting AI outputs without clear guidelines or oversight results in inconsistent or unusable designs.`,
        `**Lack of Validation**: Skipping checks on generated frames or styles causes broken components and UX regressions.`,
        `**Token Exposure**: Hardcoding access tokens or sending private assets to unsecured endpoints opens vulnerabilities.`
      ]
    },
  
    apiScripting: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: API-based Scripting',
      content: [
        `Use the REST API (e.g., GET /v1/files, POST comments) and Plugin API (e.g., figma.currentPage.appendChild()) to programmatically create or modify nodes. Automate bulk tasks—like renaming layers, applying Style IDs, or importing image URLs—by writing scripts in Node.js or within Figma plugins. Proper error handling, rate-limit respect, and modular script design are key to maintainable automation.`
      ]
    },
  
    pluginAuthoring: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Plugin Authoring',
      content: [
        `Build custom plugins with the UI API (figma.showUI) and Node API to add panels, dialogs, and commands that interact with the document. Examples include component factories that generate button libraries from a JSON spec, or automation scripts that enforce naming conventions. Store configuration in clientStorage to persist settings across sessions.`
      ]
    },
  
    textToDesign: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Text-to-Design AI',
      content: [
        `Craft prompts that specify layout structure (e.g., “Create a 3-column feature section with icons and headings”), color schemes, and typography rules. Iterate on the generated designs by refining prompts and applying manual adjustments. Combine AI outputs with component libraries to ensure brand alignment.`
      ]
    },
  
    figJamAI: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: FigJam AI',
      content: [
        `Use FigJam’s AI features to generate mind maps, user-journey diagrams, or workshop templates from simple textual descriptions. Customize generated layouts and labels, then export to Figma for high-fidelity UI development.`
      ]
    },
  
    imageToDesign: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Image-to-Design AI',
      content: [
        `Convert JPEG/PNG inputs into vector shapes using AI vectorization plugins, extract cohesive color palettes, and infer grid structures. Use these as starting points for style exploration or as direct components within your Figma files.`
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion: `By combining code-driven scripts, custom plugins, and AI-powered generation methods, frontend engineers can automate design creation, explore innovative layouts, and maintain rigorous consistency. Incorporating validation and security best practices ensures that generated designs integrate seamlessly into your development workflow and uphold quality standards.`
