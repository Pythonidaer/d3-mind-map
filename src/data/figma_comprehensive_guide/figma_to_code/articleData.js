    introduction: `The “Figma-to-Code” landscape encompasses a spectrum of approaches—from basic Dev Mode snippets to AI-powered generators and full CI/CD integrations. Understanding these options helps frontend engineers choose the right balance between automation and manual refinement, ensuring that generated code is maintainable, performant, and true to the original design.`,

      title: 'Key Principles of Figma-to-Code Workflows',
      content: [
        `**Built-in Code Snippets**: Use Dev Mode’s auto-generated CSS, SwiftUI, Compose, or XML snippets as a quick reference or starting point for styling individual elements.`,
        `**Third-Party Export Tools**: Leverage platforms like Anima, DhiWise, Zeplin, and Avocode to export larger sections or entire pages as code templates, bridging design and development at scale.`,
        `**Design-Token Tools**: Employ plugins and CLIs—such as Figma Tokens or Style Dictionary—to export shared design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) into your codebase, maintaining a single source of truth.`,
        `**AI-Based Generation**: Explore emerging AI services (TeleportHQ, Uizard) that can interpret designs or text prompts to produce React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS code, accelerating prototyping.`,
        `**CI/CD Integration**: Automate the pipeline by pulling Figma updates into build processes—syncing tokens, exporting assets, and regenerating style files without manual steps.`

    },
  
    benefits: {
      title: 'Benefits for Frontend Engineers',
      content: [
        `**Speed**: Automate repetitive code generation tasks to focus on business logic and polish rather than boilerplate styling.`,
        `**Consistency**: Ensure that your code uses the exact values defined in Figma—avoiding drift between design and implementation.`,
        `**Scalability**: Handle large design systems programmatically, whether you’re exporting a handful of assets or synchronizing thousands of tokens across multiple projects.`,
        `**Experimentation**: Rapidly spin up prototypes or landing pages directly from your design files, facilitating quick validation and iteration.`,
        `**Reliability**: Integrated pipelines reduce human error—every build can regenerate code from the latest design, keeping production aligned with your source of truth.`
      ]
    },
  
    cons: {
      title: 'Challenges & Considerations',
      content: [
        `**Quality Control**: Auto-generated code often requires manual cleanup—without oversight, you risk shipping unsemantic HTML, bloated styles, or accessibility gaps.`,
        `**Tool Dependence**: Overreliance on proprietary export tools can create lock-in, making migrations or customizations difficult later.`,
        `**Performance Overhead**: Bulk exports or token syncs in CI can slow your build times if not optimized or cached properly.`,
        `**Maintenance Burden**: Generated artifacts may diverge from hand-written code over time, requiring governance to keep the codebase consistent and clean.`
      ]
    },
  
    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
      content: [
        `**Overreliance on Auto-Code**: Assuming generated code is production-ready without reviewing or refactoring leads to unmaintainable outputs.`,
        `**Ignoring Manual Refinement**: Skipping the cleanup and optimization steps, resulting in performance bloat and accessibility issues.`,
        `**Proprietary Tool Lock-In**: Building critical pipelines around a single vendor makes future migrations or custom feature development costly.`,
        `**Neglecting Code Quality**: Allowing verbose or non-semantic code to enter the codebase compromises SEO, accessibility, and long-term maintainability.`
      ]
    },
  
    builtInSnippets: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Built-in Code Snippets',
      content: [
        `Dev Mode’s Inspect panel generates CSS snippets for selected layers, translating fills, strokes, typography, and spacing into px or rem values. It also offers platform-specific snippets (SwiftUI, Compose, XML) that can jumpstart mobile UI implementations. While convenient for small components, these snippets typically cover only basic style properties—more complex layouts (flex containers, grid patterns) often require manual mapping and adjustments in code.`
      ]
    },
  
    exportTools: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Third-Party Export Tools',
      content: [
        `**Anima** exports responsive HTML and CSS by converting Figma Auto Layout into Flexbox or CSS Grid, maintaining your design’s structure. **DhiWise** layers on an editable code editor, letting you hook into APIs and refine generated logic before export. **Zeplin** and **Avocode** focus on style guides, asset pipelines, and code snippets—from SCSS variables to React component stubs—making them favorites for collaborative handoffs in larger teams. Each tool balances ease-of-use with the level of manual intervention required post-export.`
      ]
    },
  
    designTokenTools: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: Design-Token Tools',
      content: [
        `**Figma Tokens** plugin exports your shared Styles and Variables as JSON, CSS custom properties, or platform-specific token files—ideal for syncing with Style Dictionary or Theo. **Style Dictionary** then ingests these tokens to generate language-specific constants (SCSS maps, JavaScript objects, Android resource files), ensuring that your color palettes, typography scales, and spacing units stay in lockstep between design and code.`
      ]
    },
  
    aiCodeGeneration: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: AI-Based Generation',
      content: [
        `Emerging platforms like **TeleportHQ** and **Uizard** leverage AI to interpret your Figma layout or even free-form sketches, producing React, Vue, or standard HTML/CSS code. While still maturing, these tools can dramatically accelerate early-stage prototyping. They shine when you need a quick, workable baseline but should be used alongside rigorous review processes to address semantic, accessibility, and performance considerations.`
      ]
    },
  
    pipelineIntegration: {
      title: 'Deep Dive: CI/CD Integration',
      content: [
        `Incorporate Figma exports into your build pipeline via tools like the **Figma CLI** or custom scripts. For example, a GitHub Action can fetch your design tokens JSON, run Style Dictionary to generate CSS/JS assets, and commit them back to your repo on every PR. Similarly, automated asset exports can update your CDN with optimized images whenever frames change. Proper caching, incremental builds, and error-handling ensure these automated steps run quickly and reliably without blocking your deployment workflows.`
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion: `Selecting the right Figma-to-Code strategy involves balancing automation with manual oversight. By combining built-in snippets, third-party exporters, design-token pipelines, AI assistance, and robust CI/CD integrations—while vigilantly enforcing code quality—you can streamline your workflow, maintain fidelity to design intent, and ship production-ready, maintainable code.`
