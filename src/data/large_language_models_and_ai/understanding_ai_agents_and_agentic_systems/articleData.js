    introduction: `AI agents represent the next evolutionary step in artificial intelligence, moving beyond static interactions to systems capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, and acting. 
  Understanding the components, behaviors, and types of AI agents is essential for developers aiming to build powerful, intelligent applications that do more than merely respond to prompts.`,

    conclusion: `AI agents introduce a transformative capability into software applications: autonomy.
  By moving beyond simple conversation toward goal-directed action, memory retention, tool use, and planning, developers can create systems that adapt and operate intelligently in real-world environments.
  Understanding the structures and principles behind agentic systems is crucial for leveraging the full potential of modern AI in building the next generation of applications.`,
