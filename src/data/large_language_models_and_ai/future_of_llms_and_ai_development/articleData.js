    introduction: `The landscape of LLM development is evolving at breakneck speed. 
  What we've covered so far represents today's best practices — but tomorrow's systems will look even more powerful, 
  complex, and intertwined with human life. Developers who understand emerging trends and cultivate the right mindset 
  will be best positioned to shape the future of AI responsibly and successfully.`,
