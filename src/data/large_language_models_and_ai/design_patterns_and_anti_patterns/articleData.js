    introduction: `Building reliable, scalable, and safe LLM-powered applications requires more than clever prompting. 
  Applying proven design patterns — and consciously avoiding common anti-patterns — is crucial for structuring workflows, improving output quality, 
  and maintaining long-term system health. Understanding these patterns helps developers design more robust, extensible, and production-ready AI solutions.`,

  // Step 2: Act
  agent.useTool("FlightSearchAPI", { destination: "Tokyo" });
  
  // Step 3: Observe
  agent.observe("Received flight options.");
  
  // Step 4: Reason again

    conclusion: `Mastering design patterns — and rigorously avoiding anti-patterns — separates experimental LLM prototypes 
  from reliable, production-grade AI systems. Structured prompting, retrieval augmentation, modular multi-agent design, observability, 
  and secure system boundaries form the foundation of scalable, maintainable, trustworthy LLM applications. 
  As the field evolves, new patterns will emerge, but the core principle remains: structure matters.`,
