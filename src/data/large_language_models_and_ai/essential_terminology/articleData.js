    introduction: `Understanding the key terminology around LLMs and agentic AI systems is critical for developers entering this space. 
  These foundational terms clarify how models function, how agents operate, and how various components interact to form intelligent workflows. 
  A solid grasp of this vocabulary will accelerate learning, development, and effective communication within the AI field.`,

        code: `// Example: Text splitting into tokens
  Input: "Hello, AI!"
  Tokens: ["Hello", ",", "AI", "!"]

        title: 'Simple Example: ReAct Pattern (Conceptual)',
        code: `// Reasoning and Acting loop
  Agent: "I need to find a flight to Tokyo."
  (Reason) → "I should use a flight search tool."
  (Action) → Call FlightSearchAPI with user preferences.
  (Observation) → Receive flight options.
  (Reason) → "Select the cheapest direct flight."
  (Action) → Confirm booking.`,

    conclusion: `A strong command of core terminology unlocks deeper understanding of how LLMs, agents, planning modules, memory systems, and external tools all interconnect. 
  Mastering this vocabulary ensures developers can participate effectively in building, discussing, and innovating in the next generation of intelligent AI applications. 
  Continuous learning and adaptation will remain essential as new terms and techniques emerge in this fast-moving field.`,
