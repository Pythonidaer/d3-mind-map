    introduction: `Building a complete, production-ready LLM application often requires much more than just the core model itself. 
  Modern AI projects depend on supporting frontend frameworks, backend services, search tools, and orchestration libraries 
  to deliver user-friendly, scalable, and intelligent experiences. Understanding these related technologies enables developers 
  to design and deploy full systems, not just isolated prompts.`,

    conclusion: `Mastering LLM development today means mastering a broader ecosystem of supporting tools. 
  Modern applications integrate frontend frameworks like Next.js and React, backend APIs like FastAPI, retrieval systems like Tavily, 
  and orchestrators like LangChain and LangGraph. By thoughtfully combining these technologies, developers can create 
  rich, dynamic, secure, and user-friendly AI experiences that push beyond simple chatbot demos into real-world innovation.`,
