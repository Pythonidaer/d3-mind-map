    introduction: `Building applications with LLMs and agentic systems requires a development mindset that embraces experimentation, iteration, and constant refinement. 
  Unlike traditional deterministic software development, working with LLMs involves navigating non-deterministic outputs, fine-tuning behavior, 
  and preparing systems for real-world deployment conditions. Understanding structured workflows and production-readiness factors is critical for success.`,

    conclusion: `Developing reliable LLM and agentic applications requires embracing an iterative, experiment-driven approach rather than expecting predictable behavior from the outset. 
  Establishing clear workflows, metrics, and production-readiness practices dramatically increases project success rates. 
  By systematically planning each phase—scoping, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring—developers can transform the power of LLMs into robust, scalable, 
  real-world applications that continue to evolve and improve over time.`,
