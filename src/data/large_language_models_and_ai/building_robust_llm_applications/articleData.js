    introduction: `Moving from a working prototype to a full production LLM application requires careful planning, structured workflows, and ongoing operational discipline. 
  Building and deploying LLM systems is an iterative, multi-stage process that blends traditional software engineering best practices with 
  the unique needs of AI systems like non-determinism, scaling, and continuous learning.`,

    conclusion: `Building and deploying LLM applications isn't just about achieving impressive demos — it's about creating sustainable, scalable, 
  and trustworthy systems that serve users effectively over time. From requirements gathering to deployment workflows to LLMOps practices, 
  every stage requires careful design and continuous vigilance. The teams that plan for production realities — not just prototype success — 
  will define the next generation of transformative AI-powered experiences.`,
