    introduction: `Deploying LLMs into production offers incredible possibilities but also introduces serious challenges. 
  Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLM systems in real-world environments allows developers, architects, and product owners 
  to set appropriate expectations, design better workflows, and proactively mitigate risks before they escalate.`,

        'High infrastructure costs for serving LLMs (e.g., GPUs, memory, API costs) can scale dramatically with user growth.',
        'Lack of clear explainability makes it difficult to audit, debug, or guarantee specific behaviors.',
        'Domain-specific understanding remains fragile without reinforcement from techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).',
        'Evolving regulations around AI usage introduce compliance uncertainty, especially for healthcare, finance, and government sectors.',

      title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
      content: [
        'Deploying LLMs without safety layers (validation, moderation, hallucination filtering) increases risk of public failures.',
        'Treating LLMs as deterministic APIs instead of designing for their probabilistic and variable nature.',
        'Failing to monitor model performance, cost, and bias continuously after production launch.',

        code: `// Adding audit metadata around LLM outputs
  const output = await llm.generate(prompt);
  
  return {
    output,
    metadata: {
      modelVersion: "gpt-4.1",
      promptId: "userQuery123",

    conclusion: `Large Language Models offer incredible power for modern applications, but that power must be used thoughtfully. 
  While their versatility, generalization, and automation potential are undeniable, hallucination risks, security concerns, 
  governance needs, and unpredictable scaling costs must be factored into every design and deployment decision. 
  Treating LLMs as living, evolving systems—with continuous monitoring, safeguards, and ethical oversight—is the key 
  to turning them from experimental curiosities into trusted, production-grade assets.`,
