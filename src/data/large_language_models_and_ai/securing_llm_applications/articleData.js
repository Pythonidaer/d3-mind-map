    introduction: `As LLM-powered applications move into production, they become attractive targets for a wide range of attacks: 
  prompt injection, data leaks, abuse of external tools, and system manipulation. 
  Proactively designing for security — not reacting after breaches — is critical for protecting users, businesses, and society.`,

    conclusion: `Security cannot be an afterthought when deploying LLM applications at scale. 
  Every part of the system — from prompt handling to tool usage to memory and logging — must be designed with proactive threat modeling, 
  continuous monitoring, and layered defense. By making security a first-class citizen alongside UX, performance, and scalability, 
  developers can ensure that LLM systems remain safe, reliable, and beneficial as they grow in complexity and reach.`,
