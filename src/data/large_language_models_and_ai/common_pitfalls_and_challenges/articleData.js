    conclusion: `Anticipating common technical challenges and design pitfalls is essential for building successful LLM and agentic systems. 
  By proactively addressing objectives, data quality, scalability, security, and LLM limitations, developers can avoid costly mistakes 
  and create systems that are reliable, scalable, and capable of continuous improvement. 
  Real-world success comes from both technical skill and careful risk management throughout the entire development lifecycle.`,
