  introduction: `Crosscutting architectures focus on patterns that blend frontend and backend concerns or orchestrate interactions across multiple systems. These architectures are crucial for enabling seamless communication, composing systems from different services, and building scalable full-stack solutions. This guide explores crosscutting architecture patterns in detail, grouped into API strategies, fullstack patterns, and integration/composition techniques.`,

  principle1: {
    title: 'Prioritize Efficient Communication',
    content: [
      'Crosscutting architectures rely on seamless interaction between services and layers. Ensure APIs are lightweight, versioned, and well-documented to minimize friction between frontend and backend teams.',
      'Consider GraphQL or optimized REST endpoints when traditional methods introduce performance bottlenecks.',
    ],
  },

  principle2: {
    title: 'Design for Composability',
    content: [
      'Architecture should allow new services, pages, or capabilities to be composed easily from existing building blocks.',
      'Favor reusable APIs, self-contained components, and standards like OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas to reduce onboarding time and encourage experimentation.',
    ],
  },

  principle3: {
    title: 'Pragmatic Frontend/Backend Separation',
    content: [
      'Avoid rigid separations that harm performance or flexibility. Some full-stack patterns like BFF or isomorphic rendering blend concerns for better user experience.',
      'Focus on delivering clear interfaces and responsibilities, not dogmatic tier enforcement.',
    ],
  },

  principle4: {
    title: 'Treat APIs as Products',
    content: [
      'APIs are not just internal tools—they’re public contracts. Invest in thoughtful versioning, comprehensive documentation, and backwards compatibility planning.',
      'Design APIs with consumers in mind, offering intuitive naming, predictable responses, and clear error handling.',
    ],
  },

  principle5: {
    title: 'Favor Loose Coupling',
    content: [
      'Tightly bound frontends and backends lead to brittle systems. Use API contracts, shared schemas, and clear ownership boundaries to minimize assumptions across teams.',
      'Loose coupling promotes independent development, scalable testing, and safer refactors.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits of Crosscutting Architectures',
    content: [
      'Improved flexibility to swap or upgrade backend and frontend technologies.',
      'More scalable and maintainable full-stack systems.',
      'Better developer experience through clear API contracts.',
      'Faster composition of new applications by reusing services and APIs.',
      'Ability to deliver consistent omnichannel experiences (web, mobile, IoT).',

    title: 'Challenges of Crosscutting Architectures',
    content: [
      'Increased complexity in managing distributed systems.',
      'Coordination overhead between teams owning different layers.',

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Common Crosscutting Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      'Over-fetching or under-fetching data due to poorly designed APIs.',
      'Tight coupling between specific frontend and backend components.',
      'Duplicating business logic across frontend and backend layers.',
      'Building monolithic gateways that become single points of failure.',
    ],
  },

  apiCommunication: {
    title: 'API and Communication Patterns',
    content: [
      '**RESTful API Architecture**: RESTful APIs expose resources over standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). They are easy to reason about but can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching in complex scenarios.',
      '**GraphQL Architecture**: GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching. It centralizes query logic and makes APIs more flexible, but requires strict governance to avoid performance issues.',
      '**Federated GraphQL Architecture**: Federation allows multiple GraphQL services owned by different teams to compose into a single graph. This promotes service ownership and scalability while offering clients a unified API.',
      '**API Gateway Architecture**: An API Gateway acts as a single entry point to route requests, handle authentication, manage rate limiting, and transform data between clients and backend services.',
      '**Multi-Backend Federation**: Combines different protocols like REST, GraphQL, and gRPC behind a unified abstraction layer, allowing frontend applications to interact with diverse backends seamlessly.',
    ],
  },

  fullstackPatterns: {
    title: 'Frontend-Leaning Full Stack Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Isomorphic Apps**: In isomorphic or universal apps (e.g., Next.js), code can run on both the server and the client. This enables server-side rendering for SEO and performance while maintaining rich client interactivity.',
      '**Backend-on-Frontend (BOF)**: In BOF architectures, frontend applications query APIs directly without an intermediate server. This simplifies architecture but requires careful security and performance handling.',
      '**Headless CMS Architecture**: Content is managed in CMS systems (e.g., Contentful, Strapi) and accessed via APIs by frontend apps. This decouples content management from presentation and enables omnichannel delivery.',
    ],
  },

  integrationAndComposition: {
    title: 'Integration and Composition Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Composable Architecture**: Applications are composed from reusable SaaS services, APIs, microservices, and frontend components. This enables rapid development and flexible evolution of digital experiences.',
      '**Multi-Tenant Architecture**: A single backend instance serves multiple tenants (customers), either with shared databases or isolated resources per tenant. This approach optimizes resource usage and simplifies deployment.',
      '**Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate asynchronously by emitting and responding to events. This decouples producers and consumers, improves scalability, and enables more reactive, flexible system designs.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Basic REST API Example (Express.js)',
      code: `const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  
  app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
    res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'Laptop' }]);
  });
  
  app.listen(3000);`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Simple GraphQL Server (Apollo)',
      code: `const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql\`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
\`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello World!'
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen();`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Event-Driven Publisher Example (Node.js)',
      code: `const EventEmitter = require('events');
  const eventBus = new EventEmitter();
  
  eventBus.on('userCreated', (user) => {
    console.log('Send welcome email to', user.email);
  });
  
  // Somewhere in your app
  const user = { id: 1, email: 'test@example.com' };
  eventBus.emit('userCreated', user);`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Isomorphic Data Fetching (Next.js)',
      code: `export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products');
    const products = await res.json();
    return { props: { products } };
  }
  
  export default function Products({ products }) {
    return products.map(p => <div key={p.id}>{p.name}</div>);
  }`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Headless CMS Fetch Example',
      code: `async function fetchContent() {
    const res = await fetch('https://cms.example.com/api/posts');
    const posts = await res.json();
    return posts;
  }`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Crosscutting architectures enable modern applications to evolve flexibly, integrate powerful APIs and services, and deliver rich full-stack experiences. Mastery of these patterns unlocks scalable, modular, and resilient system designs suited for today's multi-platform digital landscape.`,
