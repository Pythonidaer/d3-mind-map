  introduction: `Frontend architecture defines how a web application's interface, structure, and user interactions are organized. Strategic frontend design choices determine performance, scalability, maintainability, and user satisfaction. This guide comprehensively explains modern frontend architectures, focusing on rendering strategies, component patterns, state management, and modularization.`,

  renderingStrategies: {
    title: 'Rendering Strategies',
    content: [
      '**Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: CSR loads minimal HTML and relies on JavaScript to render views dynamically on the browser. This approach offloads work from the server but can hurt SEO and first contentful paint unless handled carefully.',
      '**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: SSR generates full HTML on the server for each request, sending complete pages to users immediately. This boosts SEO and perceived performance but can increase server load.',
      "**Isomorphic / Universal Rendering**: Isomorphic applications render both on the server and hydrate seamlessly on the client. This combines SSR's SEO benefits with CSR's interactivity and is widely used in frameworks like Next.js.",
      '**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: ISR pre-renders pages at build time but allows specific pages to be updated incrementally without a full rebuild, balancing freshness with static performance.',
      '**Progressive Web App (PWA)**: PWAs combine web reachability with app-like features such as offline caching, push notifications, and installability. This improves engagement and retention rates significantly.',
      '**Islands Architecture**: Islands architecture sends static HTML and hydrates only small interactive "islands," reducing JavaScript bundle size. Ideal for content-heavy sites where only parts need to be dynamic.',
      '**Jamstack Architecture**: Jamstack prebuilds static assets and uses APIs for dynamic needs. It improves performance, security, and scaling while simplifying hosting with CDNs.',
      '**Buildless Architecture**: Buildless setups serve native ES modules directly without heavy bundling steps, simplifying deployments and speeding up build times especially for smaller, modular apps.',
    ],
  },

  componentPatterns: {
    title: 'Component and State Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Component-Based Architecture**: UI is divided into small, independently manageable pieces (components), each responsible for its behavior and rendering. Frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte encourage this pattern.',
      '**Functional Core / Imperative Shell**: The "functional core" handles pure logic, while the "imperative shell" handles effects like API calls or DOM mutations, promoting testability and clear separation of concerns.',
      '**State Machine-Based UI**: State machines model frontend behavior explicitly, defining allowed transitions between states. This reduces bugs in complex flows and improves predictability.',
      '**Flux / Redux Architecture**: Flux introduced unidirectional data flow patterns, where actions modify a centralized store through reducers. Redux expanded this concept into production-grade state containers.',
      '**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: MVVM structures UIs around ViewModels, which manage data and logic separately from the Views, offering two-way binding. Popular in frameworks like Angular and Knockout.js.',
      '**MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: MVC divides applications into Models (data), Views (UI), and Controllers (interaction handlers), a traditional but still relevant pattern for simple or custom setups.',
    ],
  },

  modularizationStrategies: {
    title: 'Modularization and Extensible Frontends',
    content: [
      '**Micro Frontends**: Each feature or page is owned end-to-end by a separate team, independently developed, tested, and deployed. This scales frontend development across large teams.',
      '**Module Federation**: Webpack Module Federation enables separate builds to dynamically consume each other’s code, allowing runtime integration of independently deployed frontend apps.',
      '**Web Component Architecture**: Web Components use browser-native APIs to encapsulate UI functionality, supporting reusable widgets independent of JavaScript framework choices.',
      '**Meta-Framework Architecture**: Meta-frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, Remix, and SvelteKit integrate routing, SSR, caching, and tooling around core libraries to enable scalable production-ready applications.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'CSR Example in React',
      code: `import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  if (!data) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}`,
    },
    {
      title: 'SSR Example in Next.js',
      code: `export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}`,
    },
    {
      title: 'State Machine Example (XState)',
      code: `import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react';
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'inactive',
  states: {
    inactive: { on: { TOGGLE: 'active' } },
    active: { on: { TOGGLE: 'inactive' } },
  },
});

export default function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggleMachine);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => send('TOGGLE')}>
      {state.matches('inactive') ? 'Off' : 'On'}
    </button>
  );
}`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Frontend architecture is the foundation of any successful modern web application. Through careful choice of rendering strategies, thoughtful state and component design, and modular extensibility, developers can deliver fast, scalable, and delightful user experiences. A solid frontend architecture is not just a technical choice—it is a product strategy.`,
