    introduction: `
      JavaScript's core fundamentals form the foundation for writing robust, maintainable code. 
      These concepts include syntax, control flow, function design, scope behavior, and execution context. 
      Mastery of these areas empowers developers to understand how JavaScript behaves at its most essential level.

        "**Syntax:** JavaScript's syntax defines how code is written and interpreted. It includes declarations, operators, and expressions that form the base for logic and data manipulation.",
        "**Logic (Control Flow):** Control flow constructs determine how code executes based on conditions and loops. This includes branching with `if`, `switch`, and loops like `for`, `while`.",
        "**Functions:** Functions encapsulate logic and promote reuse. They're central to JS, with support for first-class functions, closures, default parameters, and arrow functions.",
        "**Scope:** JavaScript uses lexical scoping to control variable accessibility. Knowing the difference between global, function, and block scope is critical for managing state and avoiding bugs.",
        "**Context (`this`):** Execution context refers to the value of `this` in different environments — which changes based on how a function is invoked. Arrow functions simplify this by using lexical `this`.",

    cons: {
      title: "Cons / Challenges",
      content: [
        "**Scope Confusion:** JavaScript’s `var`, `let`, and `const` can cause confusion, especially when hoisting comes into play.",
        "**Dynamic `this`:** The `this` keyword behaves differently depending on how functions are called, which can trip up newcomers.",
        "**Type Coercion:** Implicit type conversion can cause unexpected behavior if you're not careful (e.g., `\"\" == 0` is true).",
        "**Silent Failures:** JavaScript doesn't throw many errors by default (e.g., accessing undeclared variables creates globals in sloppy mode),",
        "**Overuse of Globals:** Without strict scoping, global variables can pollute your namespace and lead to bugs.",

    antiPatterns: {
      title: "Common Anti-Patterns",
      content: [
        "**Global Variable Pollution:** Avoid defining too many global variables. Use `const` or `let` inside blocks to contain scope.",
        "**Overusing `var`:** Stick with `let` and `const`. `var` is function-scoped and leads to bugs due to hoisting.",
        "**Improper `this` Usage:** Calling methods without binding `this` (or using arrow functions) can lead to unexpected context.",
        "**Too Many Nested Loops:** Deep nesting harms readability. Use functions to flatten logic.",
        "**Anonymous Functions Everywhere:** While concise, overusing anonymous functions can hurt debugging and maintainability.",

    conclusion: `
      The core concepts of JavaScript — syntax, control flow, functions, scope, and execution context — form the basis of all code you’ll write. 
      By mastering these foundational ideas, you'll be equipped to build cleaner, more maintainable, and bug-resistant applications. 
      Combine these concepts with best practices, proper testing, and architecture to take full advantage of JavaScript's power and flexibility.
