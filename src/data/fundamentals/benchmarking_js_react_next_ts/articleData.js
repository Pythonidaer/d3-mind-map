  introduction:
    'Benchmarking JavaScript, React, Next.js, and TypeScript involves systematically measuring the performance of both code-level operations (microbenchmarking) and application-level behavior (page load, rendering, and interactivity). This practice helps uncover bottlenecks, ensure responsive UI, and improve perceived and actual performance. This article breaks down every layer of benchmarking using modern tools and metrics, helping you optimize performance in a structured, measurable way.',

    content: [
      'Microbenchmarking is the practice of measuring how long small pieces of code take to execute. These measurements are most useful when comparing different coding strategies or implementations.',
      'Use cases include testing loop types, function call overhead, object access patterns, and allocation costs.',
      'Rather than relying on intuition, microbenchmarks give data-driven feedback on performance-critical sections of code.',

  high_resolution_timers: {
    title: 'High-Resolution Timers',
    content: [
      '`performance.now()` in browsers and `process.hrtime()` or `performance.now()` in Node.js provide accurate sub-millisecond timing.',
      'Unlike `Date.now()`, high-resolution timers are not affected by system clock changes and offer far better precision.',
      "They're suitable for measuring durations in microbenchmarks or wrapping important operations in runtime logic.",

    title: 'Benchmark Libraries',
    content: [
      'Benchmark.js is a robust tool that automates running test functions repeatedly, warming up the JIT, and calculating statistical variance.',
      'It reports metrics like ops/sec and margin of error. These benchmarks help identify the most efficient approach in complex decisions.',
      '`jsPerf` was a historical web-based tool for this, but most developers now run controlled local benchmarks for repeatability.',

  test_strategies: {
    title: 'Test Strategies',
    content: [
      'Run your benchmark millions of times to smooth out noise and get reliable averages.',
      'Always benchmark in production mode where bundlers remove debug code and optimize output.',
      'Avoid console.logs, and disable unrelated extensions or network connections that may skew results.',
      "Garbage collection and JIT compilation can still introduce variation, so it's essential to warm up the code path before timing.",

    title: 'Application Performance & Metrics',
    content: [
      'Beyond raw execution speed, real-world applications require evaluating how fast pages load, when content becomes visible, and how interactive the UI feels.',
      'Key metrics include Web Vitals (like FCP, LCP, INP), JavaScript bundle size, memory usage, and rendering/hydration time in frameworks.',

      '**TTFB (Time to First Byte):** Measures server speed—how long it takes to start receiving data.',
      '**CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Tracks visual jank from moving content. Target: < 0.1.',
      '**INP (Interaction to Next Paint):** Measures how responsive your app is to user input. Replaces TTI/FID in modern Lighthouse.',

  bundle_size: {
    title: 'Bundle Size',
    content: [
      'The size of your JavaScript bundles significantly affects loading and parsing times.',
      'Larger bundles cause delays in Time to Interactive (TTI), especially on slow networks or low-powered devices.',

    title: 'Hydration & Render Performance',
    content: [
      "In server-side rendered apps like Next.js, React must 'hydrate' the server-sent HTML by attaching event listeners and re-rendering components.",

  conclusion:
    'Benchmarking isn’t just for performance-obsessed engineers—it’s a vital part of building scalable, responsive applications. By combining code-level insights with holistic application metrics, developers can make better architectural decisions, measure the impact of optimizations, and ensure consistent UX across environments. Make benchmarking a routine part of your workflow, not a last resort.',
