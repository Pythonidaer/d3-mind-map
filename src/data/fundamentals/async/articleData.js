    introduction: `
      Asynchronous JavaScript enables programs to perform non-blocking operations like data fetching, timers, and event handling.
      Key async models include callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop. Mastering them is essential for responsive, performant applications.

      content: [
        "**Callbacks:** The earliest async model — passing a function to run once a task finishes. Simple but prone to nesting (callback hell).",
        "**Promises:** Abstractions for values that may arrive in the future. Use `.then`, `.catch`, and combinators like `Promise.all`.",
        "**Async/Await:** A syntax layer over promises that makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code using `async` functions.",
        "**Event Loop:** JavaScript's engine handles concurrency through an event loop, processing a single thread of code via queues and tasks.",
        "**Fetch API:** Native API for making network requests using promises, replacing older XMLHttpRequest methods.",

        "**Non-Blocking Execution:** JavaScript remains responsive while awaiting slow tasks.",
        "**Cleaner Code with Await:** `async/await` leads to easier-to-read code over nested `.then()` chains.",
        "**Better Error Handling:** Promises and `try/catch` blocks help handle errors more gracefully.",
        "**Scalable Concurrency:** Use of `Promise.all` and other combinators enables powerful parallel operations.",

    cons: {
      title: "Cons / Gotchas",
      content: [
        "**Callback Hell:** Nesting callbacks becomes unreadable and hard to manage without refactoring.",
        "**Uncaught Promise Rejections:** Forgetting `.catch()` or `try/catch` can lead to silent failures.",
        "**Sequential Awaits:** Awaiting promises one by one can be slow — use `Promise.all` for parallelism.",

    antiPatterns: {
      title: "Common Anti-Patterns",
      content: [
        "**Deep Nesting:** Avoid layers of callbacks — use named functions or promises.",
        "**Blocking the Event Loop:** Expensive computation blocks async operations — use workers or chunked logic.",
        "**Forgetting `.catch()` or `try/catch`**: Always handle possible errors with proper handling patterns.",
        "**Mixing Async Styles:** Don’t mix callbacks and promises in the same flow unless you’re wrapping one into the other cleanly.",
      ],
    },
    conclusion: `
      Async JavaScript is the beating heart of dynamic front-end development — from real-time APIs to UI responsiveness.
      Embracing promises and async/await simplifies complex flows, while understanding the event loop ensures you avoid tricky bugs.
      Combine async strategies with thoughtful structure to build fast, scalable, and maintainable apps.
