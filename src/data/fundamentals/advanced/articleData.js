      content: [
        "**Code Organization:** Modules and classes create clear separation of concerns.",
        "**Advanced Patterns:** Functional tools like currying and composition encourage cleaner logic.",
        "**Runtime Efficiency:** Optimized rendering and memory use leads to faster apps.",

      title: "Cons / Gotchas",
      content: [
        "**Too Many Patterns:** Over-abstracting with functional or OOP concepts can reduce readability.",
        "**Complex Build Systems:** Module systems often require bundlers like Webpack or Vite.",
        "**Memory Leaks:** Poor DOM cleanup or event handling can result in retained objects.",
        "**Steep Learning Curve:** Advanced concepts require time and real-world experience to apply effectively.",

    antiPatterns: {
      title: "Common Anti-Patterns",
      content: [
        "**God Modules:** Modules that grow too large and try to do too much.",
        "**Deep Class Inheritance:** Prefer composition over complex inheritance hierarchies.",
        "**Uncontrolled Closures:** Retaining references longer than needed leads to memory issues.",
        "**Copy/Paste Code:** Repetition instead of reusable functions leads to bugs and bloat.",
      ],

    conclusion: `
      Mastering advanced JavaScript enables you to write professional, high-performance applications with clean architecture and predictable behavior.
      By leveraging modular code, functional strategies, and performance insights, you can build apps that scale with ease and withstand the test of time.
