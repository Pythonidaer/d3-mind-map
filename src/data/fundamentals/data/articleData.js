    introduction: `
      JavaScript provides versatile structures for modeling and manipulating data — including objects, arrays, sets, maps, and typed built-in utilities. 
      Understanding how to structure, access, transform, and design data is essential for building scalable and efficient applications.

        "**Arrays:** Ordered collections ideal for managing lists. Methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` offer powerful transformation patterns.",
        "**Built-In Types:** Native JS types like `Date`, `RegExp`, `Set`, and `Map` expand how we handle specialized data efficiently.",
        "**Patterns (Destructuring, Spread):** Modern syntax allows clearer code and easier data access. These patterns promote immutability and functional design.",

        "**Powerful Transformations:** Array methods like `map` and `reduce` simplify data processing pipelines.",
        "**Memory Efficiency:** Sets and Maps handle large datasets with better lookup time and deduplication.",

      title: "Common Anti-Patterns",
      content: [
        "**Mutating Shared Data:** Always prefer copying via spread or functional patterns to avoid shared state issues.",
        "**Array for Everything:** Sometimes a `Map` or `Set` is a better fit than cramming everything into an array.",
        "**Prototype Pollution:** Accidentally overwriting `__proto__` can introduce security issues or unpredictable behavior.",

    conclusion: `
      The data layer in JavaScript is where most of your application’s logic lives — from handling user input to fetching remote data and transforming it for the UI.
      Mastering objects, arrays, and the powerful array methods as well as applying design principles like immutability and modular construction will take your code from basic to bulletproof.
