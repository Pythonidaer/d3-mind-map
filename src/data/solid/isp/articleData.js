      The Interface Segregation Principle promotes creating smaller, more focused interfaces so that implementing classes are not forced to define unused methods.

    conclusion: `
      ISP helps reduce unnecessary dependencies by ensuring classes only implement what they actually use. It results in more modular, flexible, and client-oriented design.
