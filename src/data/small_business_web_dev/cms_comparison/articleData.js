    conclusion: `For small business owners who want control over their website content, WordPress is generally the most accessible and cost-effective option. Its wide adoption, ease of use, and community support make it ideal for non-technical users. Joomla is a reasonable choice for businesses that need more structure or built-in multilingual support but still want to avoid high developer costs. Drupal excels in power and flexibility but is best reserved for organizations with larger budgets and technical resources. When selecting a CMS, business owners should weigh not only current needs, but also long-term maintenance, training, and expansion plans.`,
