    introduction: `Understanding a client's business is the foundation of any successful website project, especially for local service-based businesses like painting and plastering. This phase of discovery allows developers to design a solution tailored to the unique identity, goals, and offerings of the business, rather than relying on one-size-fits-all templates. Below, we explore the key dimensions developers should address to ensure alignment and clarity from day one.`,
  
    servicesOffered: {
      title: 'Services Offered',
      content: [
        'Begin by identifying the full spectrum of services the painting or plastering business provides. These could include interior painting, exterior painting, commercial work, plaster repairs, decorative finishes, and more.',
        'Understanding this range helps define the sitemap, menu labels, service pages, and SEO keywords that will be important to surface online.',
        'Ask follow-ups like: Are there seasonal services? Are there jobs they specialize in or actively avoid?' 
      ],
    },
  
    targetAudience: {
      title: 'Target Audience',
      content: [
        'Determine who the business primarily serves. Residential homeowners, landlords, property managers, or general contractors may all have different expectations.',
        'If they target high-end homeowners, visuals and branding might be more premium. If they target landlords, highlight speed, reliability, and affordability.',
        'Clarifying this early will guide tone, content focus, testimonials, and more.'
      ],
    },
  
    geographicArea: {
      title: 'Geographic Area',
      content: [
        'Clarify where the client operates to enable accurate local SEO and service area messaging. Ask them what towns, counties, or regions they cover.',
        'This affects search engine ranking, footer content, and whether a map feature should be embedded on the site.',
        'It can also influence keyword strategy and call-to-actions (“Call now for painting services in Salem, MA!”)' 
      ],
    },
  
    uniqueSellingPoints: {
      title: 'Unique Selling Points (USPs)',
      content: [
        'Ask the client what makes them different from competitors. If they aren’t sure, guide them by exploring common angles: years in business, customer testimonials, niche expertise, warranty guarantees, eco-friendly products, or team size.',
        'A clear value proposition should appear on the homepage and echoed in CTAs, testimonials, and service copy.',
        'If they don’t articulate it, this is a chance to help them define their brand message for both design and copywriting.'
      ],
    },
  
    businessGoals: {
      title: 'Business Goals',
      content: [
        'Finally, determine what the business owner hopes the website will help them achieve: more leads, more calls, brand recognition, bigger contracts, or better reputation.',
        'These goals shape everything from homepage layout to SEO strategy to contact form prominence.',
        'Set clear expectations here so that both you and the client can later measure success using specific KPIs.'
      ],
    },
  
    conclusion: `A successful discovery process isn’t just about gathering raw data—it’s about extracting clarity and alignment from the client. Understanding their services, audience, location, and goals sets the stage for a well-aligned web strategy. When developers ask the right questions, they not only craft a stronger digital product but also build trust and confidence that benefits the entire relationship.`
