    introduction: `Understanding a client's budget and timeline early in the process is critical to setting clear expectations, avoiding misunderstandings, and crafting a proposal that is both realistic and aligned with their goals. These factors influence the project's scope, technology choices, and development pace.`,
  
    budget_range: {
      title: 'Budget Range',
      content: [
        'Open a candid conversation about the client’s budget range. This helps you determine whether a streamlined build, mid-range customization, or fully bespoke solution is appropriate.',
        'Some clients may hesitate to share a number upfront, but framing the question in terms of ranges ("Are you looking to stay under $2k, between $2k–5k, or beyond?") can make it easier.',
        'Understanding their budget helps you prioritize features: do they want branding, custom illustrations, SEO, advanced forms, or just a clean and fast site with contact info?',
        'Clarify whether they expect a one-time cost or are open to ongoing support or maintenance packages. This distinction informs whether a flat fee, hybrid, or retainer model might apply.',
        'If a client has high expectations but a small budget, this opens the door to phased development—launching essentials first and saving advanced features for later.'
      ],
    },
  
    timeline_expectations: {
      title: 'Timeline Expectations',
      content: [
        'Ask the client if they have a target launch date or are tied to an external event (e.g., marketing campaign, seasonal push, or business expansion).',
        'Understanding deadlines lets you structure a development schedule with key milestones: discovery, design approval, content readiness, testing, and launch.',
        'Timelines influence scope: a fast turnaround may require using existing templates and streamlined designs rather than full custom UI.',
        'It also helps you identify potential blockers—like content delays, asset collection, or prolonged approval cycles—that could derail the schedule.',
        'Clarify how urgently they need the site versus how much flexibility they have. That way, you can realistically plan and deliver without last-minute surprises.'
      ],
    },
  
    conclusion: `Budget and timeline constraints are not obstacles—they're alignment tools. They ensure that you and the client are on the same page, reduce scope creep, and prevent miscommunication. Addressing them upfront sets the tone for a professional, efficient working relationship where expectations are realistic, and outcomes are achievable.`
