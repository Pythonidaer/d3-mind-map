    introduction: `Clearly identifying the objectives for a new website is essential for creating a digital product that meets the client's expectations and drives measurable results. These objectives should align with both short-term goals and broader business outcomes, ensuring the site plays a meaningful role in the client’s growth strategy.`,
  
    primary_goals: {
      title: 'Primary Goals',
      content: [
        'The first step in defining website objectives is to ask the client what they hope to accomplish. Common goals include increasing inquiries, generating leads, showcasing a portfolio, enhancing credibility, or attracting more local visibility.',
        'Understanding their priorities helps shape content structure, calls-to-action, and page hierarchy. For example, if lead generation is the main goal, then contact forms, quote requests, and phone numbers should be prominent on every page.',
        'If the goal is brand building, visuals and messaging consistency across the homepage, about section, and testimonials will be key.',
      ],

      title: 'KPIs & Success Metrics',
      content: [
        'Once the goals are defined, the next step is to determine how success will be measured. Ask the client: How will you know if the website is working?',
        'Typical metrics include the number of contact form submissions, phone calls from the site, Google Analytics traffic data, or time on page.',
        'By establishing clear KPIs early on, both client and developer can align expectations and track ROI. This also opens the door for future conversations about optimization and SEO improvements.',
      ],
    },
  
    marketing_integration: {
      title: 'Marketing Integration',
      content: [
        'The website should act as the central hub for all marketing efforts. Ask whether the client is using social media, local advertising, business cards, or other channels.',
        'Ensure there are clear pathways for users to follow from those channels to the website, and vice versa. For example, social icons should be present on the site, and the client’s Facebook page should link back to their site.',
        'This is also a chance to align messaging, visual style, and tone across mediums—ensuring the brand feels consistent whether someone finds them on Instagram or through Google search.',
      ],
    },
  
    conclusion: `Defining a website's objectives isn't just a task to check off—it sets the stage for every design, copywriting, and development decision that follows. A clear set of goals ensures the project stays focused, success can be measured, and the finished product truly supports the client’s broader business efforts.`
