    introduction: `This section focuses on the specific components, assets, and functionality a client must provide or decide upon to successfully launch a website. These requirements span branding, visuals, written content, features, and stylistic preferences—forming the tangible foundation of the build.`,
  
    domain_name: {
      title: 'Domain Name',
      content: [
        'Ask the client if they already own a domain. If so, get access details or confirmation of the registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap).',
        'If they don’t have one, guide them on choosing a domain that is short, memorable, SEO-friendly, and relevant to their business name or location (e.g., paintingSalemMA.com).',
        'Discuss optional features like WHOIS privacy and domain email addresses. Mention typical costs: $10–$20/year, with occasional promotions or bundled services from hosting providers.',
      ],
    },
  
    logo_branding: {
      title: 'Logo & Branding',
      content: [
        'Determine if the client already has a logo. If yes, request it in high-resolution formats (SVG, PNG) along with any established brand colors or typefaces.',
        'If they don’t have a logo, ask if branding services are needed. Even a simple logo and consistent palette can elevate trust.',
        'Explore their stylistic preferences—modern vs. traditional, clean vs. decorative—to establish a visual tone early on.',

    content_messaging: {
      title: 'Content & Messaging',
      content: [
        'Clarify whether the client already has written copy or will need help writing it. Don’t assume they know what to include.',
        'Break down key sections: homepage intro, service descriptions, team bios, calls-to-action, FAQs, and contact info.',
        'Ask if they have existing testimonials or case studies—they are powerful social proof and should be visible.',
        'If writing is needed, discuss tone (professional, friendly, etc.) and voice (first person vs. third person).',
      ],
    },
  
    imagery_visuals: {
      title: 'Imagery & Visuals',
      content: [
        'Ask if the client has professional photos of past projects, before-and-after shots, or staff images.',
        'If not, discuss whether stock photography will be used, or if they’re interested in a photo shoot.',
        'Images should reflect quality, safety, and trust. Even simple work-in-progress shots can be effective if authentic.',
        'Avoid generic stock images that misrepresent their business. It’s better to start with a few real photos than many unrelated ones.',
      ],
    },
  
    site_functionality: {
      title: 'Website Functionality',
      content: [
        'Define what interactive or dynamic elements the client wants now—or may need later.',
        'Examples: quote request forms, service area maps, image galleries, contact forms, testimonial sliders, or blogs.',
        'Ask if they want integrations (e.g., email marketing, CRM, analytics). Ensure the CMS or tech stack can support their vision.',
        'Also consider ADA compliance or translation features if applicable to their target market.',
      ],
    },
  
    design_preferences: {
      title: 'Design Preferences',
      content: [
        'Ask if they’ve seen websites they like—within their industry or beyond. This provides visual references.',
        'Gather info on desired color palettes, layout style (boxed vs. full-width), and preferred fonts if any.',
        'Discuss the emotional tone they want the site to convey—e.g., warm and inviting, bold and confident, or minimal and clean.',
        'Identifying early style preferences can reduce rounds of revision later.',
      ],
    },
  
    conclusion: `Getting clarity on detailed requirements early prevents miscommunications, aligns expectations, and reduces time-consuming revisions down the line. Whether a client has all their assets ready or is starting from scratch, walking them through each of these areas ensures you build a website that’s both effective and true to their brand.`
