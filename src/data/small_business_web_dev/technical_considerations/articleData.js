      content: [
        'Search engine optimization (SEO) is essential for increasing website visibility and attracting qualified leads. Even basic SEO practices can significantly improve search rankings.',
        'Ask the client if they’re familiar with SEO or have worked with keywords before. If not, provide a high-level explanation: SEO helps their site appear on Google when someone searches for services they offer.',
        'Clarify whether they expect keyword optimization, SEO-friendly URL structures, meta tags, and alt text as part of the project.',
        'If they already have preferred keywords (e.g., “plastering in Salem” or “interior painting contractor”), gather that list to guide copywriting.',

      title: 'CMS Platform Preferences',
      content: [
        'A Content Management System (CMS) determines how easily a client can update their website. The choice impacts usability, scalability, and maintenance.',
        'Ask if the client has used WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, or website builders like Wix or Squarespace. This gives insight into their comfort level and expectations.',
        'For small businesses wanting full control over updates, WordPress is often the most intuitive and cost-effective option. Joomla can offer a balance of flexibility and user-friendliness. Drupal, while powerful, is typically too complex for non-technical users.',
        'Discuss future needs—if they want to add a blog, gallery, or e-commerce later, a modular CMS like WordPress or Joomla may be preferable over simpler site builders.',

      title: 'Hosting Preferences',
      content: [
        'Web hosting makes a site publicly accessible and directly impacts performance, uptime, and support.',
        'Ask if they already have a hosting provider. If so, request login access to verify features, performance, and compatibility.',
        'If they don’t have hosting yet, recommend options based on their budget and technical confidence:',
        '- Shared Hosting: Low-cost, suitable for basic small business websites (e.g., Bluehost, SiteGround).',
        '- Managed WordPress Hosting: Higher cost, includes performance and security optimizations (e.g., WP Engine).',
        '- VPS Hosting: Mid-tier solution with more control and resources for growing sites.',
        'Ask if they want help managing hosting or prefer to handle it themselves. Also, check if they need domain-linked emails.',
      ],

    conclusion: `Clarifying the technical foundation early ensures that the website is built with the right tools for the job. By aligning SEO expectations, CMS comfort levels, and hosting plans with the client’s needs and growth plans, developers can recommend the most effective and sustainable solutions.`
