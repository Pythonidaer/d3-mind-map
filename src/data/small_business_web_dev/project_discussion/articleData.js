    introduction: `Clear, upfront communication is essential when discussing a website project with a freelance developer or agency. For small businesses especially, having structured conversations around goals, timelines, features, and pricing helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures a smoother experience.

        'The freelancer presents two pricing options: Basic ($1,800) includes all pages with a template theme; Premium ($2,600) adds SEO setup and booking integration.',
        'Midway through the project, the client requests an email signup form. The developer logs the change and estimates an extra $150 to implement it.',

    conclusion: `Well-structured project discussions create smoother builds, happier clients, and fewer surprises. From defining clear requirements and communication methods to setting transparent pricing expectations, good dialogue is key to success. Don’t be afraid to over-communicate, document everything, and ask clarifying questions. When both parties understand what’s being built, why it matters, and how changes will be handled, trust grows—and so does the quality of the final product.`,
