    introduction: `Before starting a redesign or building a new website, it's essential to assess the client's current online presence. Even a simple one-page site or placeholder page can offer insights into their familiarity with web tools, their expectations, and what isn't working for them now. This section outlines the key discovery areas to explore.`,
  
    existingSite: {
      title: 'Existing Website Details',
      content: [
        'Begin by asking if the client currently has a website. If they do, collect the URL and examine it prior to any meetings.',
        'Ask what platform it was built on: Was it created using Carrd, Wix, HTML, or a CMS like WordPress?',
        'This helps assess the technical comfort level of the client and what kind of migration or rebuild effort may be required.',
      ],
    },
  
    sitePerformance: {
      title: 'Current Site Performance',
      content: [
        'Discuss whether the current site is helping them achieve their goals. Are they getting leads? Are users finding the site easily?',
        'Ask about any known issues like slow loading times, lack of inquiries, or outdated design.',
        'Understanding their frustrations gives you a clear scope of what must be improved.',
      ],
    },
  
    redesignMotivation: {
      title: 'Motivation for Redesign',
      content: [
        'Ask why they are considering a redesign now. Are they rebranding? Expanding services? Just fed up with how their site looks or performs?',
        'Understanding their motivation helps frame the project’s purpose and prioritize what needs solving.',
        'If their reasons are vague, probe deeper to clarify expectations and potential opportunities for improvement.',
      ],
    },
  
    mobileReadiness: {
      title: 'Mobile Compatibility',
      content: [
        'Verify if their current website works well on phones and tablets. A site that looks great on desktop might be broken or hard to use on mobile.',
        'Given how many users browse from mobile, this can be a strong motivator for a redesign.',
        'If mobile readiness is poor, plan to use a responsive framework or mobile-first design strategy.',
      ],
    },
  
    analyticsTools: {
      title: 'Analytics Installed',
      content: [
        'Ask if they use any analytics tools such as Google Analytics or built-in platform metrics.',
        'If they do, request access (read-only) or a summary of traffic, bounce rate, and conversions.',
        'If they don’t use any analytics, explain how adding tracking will help measure the new site’s success.',
      ],
    },
  
    conclusion: `Evaluating a client’s current digital presence provides a starting point to define what works, what doesn't, and what expectations exist for the new website. Even if their current site is minimal, this conversation can uncover hidden needs, frustrations, and opportunities for better engagement and conversions in the new build.`,
