  introduction:
    "Routing is a fundamental aspect of both React and Next.js applications, enabling seamless navigation between different parts of a web app. Understanding the distinctions between React Router DOM and Next.js's file-system routing is crucial for designing intuitive and performant user experiences.",

    title: 'Key Routing Concepts',
    content: [
      '**React Router DOM:** A declarative routing library for React SPAs, offering flexible control over URL mappings and navigation.',
      '**Next.js File-System Routing:** Automatic route creation based on the directory and file structure, simplifying routing configuration.',
      '**Dynamic Routing:** Support for variable URL segments (e.g., /posts/[id]) enabling dynamic, parameterized routes.',
      '**Nested Routing:** Structuring routes within parent layouts to create complex, hierarchical navigation flows.',
      '**Programmatic Navigation:** Using imperative commands (e.g., router.push or navigate) to navigate based on application logic.',
      '**Prefetching:** Preloading linked pages in the background to improve navigation speed and user experience.',
      "**React Router in Next.js:** Generally discouraged due to conflicts with Next.js's server-side and routing optimizations.",

    {
      title: 'Basic React Router DOM Setup',
      code: `import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
  
  function App() {
    return (
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>

      code: `// pages/about.js
  export default function About() {
    return <h1>About Page</h1>;
  }
  // Automatically available at /about`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Next.js Dynamic Routing Example',
      code: `// pages/posts/[id].js
  import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
  
  export default function Post() {
    const router = useRouter();
    const { id } = router.query;
    return <h1>Post ID: {id}</h1>;
  }`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Programmatic Navigation in Next.js',
      code: `import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
  
  function NavigateButton() {
    const router = useRouter();
    return <button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>Go to About</button>;
  }`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    'Mastering routing strategies in React and Next.js is key to delivering intuitive, performant web experiences. Leveraging file-system routing, dynamic segments, and prefetching in Next.js offers significant advantages, while a careful, minimalistic approach to navigation logic ensures maintainability and scalability.',
