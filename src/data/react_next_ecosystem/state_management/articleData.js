  introduction:
    'State management is a critical aspect of building scalable and maintainable React and Next.js applications. It involves deciding how and where to store dynamic data and how to update the UI in response to changes.',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'State Management Techniques',
    content: [
      '**React State Tools:** useState, useReducer, and Context API provide local and shared state management directly within React components.',
      '**Redux:** A centralized, predictable state container using a single store and immutable state updates through dispatched actions and reducers.',
      '**Zustand:** A minimalistic global state management library using hooks and selective subscriptions for performance.',
      '**Context API:** Built-in mechanism for sharing state globally without prop drilling, ideal for non-frequent updates like theme or auth state.',
      '**Server vs. Client Components:** In Next.js App Router, server components are optimized for immutable data; client components are necessary for dynamic, interactive state.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      'Clear separation of concerns between UI and data handling.',
      'Predictable state updates simplify debugging and testing.',
      'Improved scalability through modular, maintainable state structures.',
      'Flexibility to use simple or advanced libraries depending on project complexity.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Cons',
    content: [
      'Overengineering small apps with heavy state libraries can cause unnecessary complexity.',
      'Improper use of Context API or global stores can lead to excessive re-renders.',
      'Complex state structures can become difficult to debug without proper tools or structure.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      'Overusing global state for everything instead of keeping local state where possible.',
      'Directly mutating state instead of following immutable update patterns.',
      'Creating deeply nested, complex state trees without modularization.',
      'Using Context API for highly dynamic, frequently updated data without memoization strategies.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Using useState in React',
      code: `import { useState } from 'react';
  
  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
    return (
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Count: {count}
      </button>
    );
  }`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Simple Redux Slice (Redux Toolkit)',
      code: `import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
  
  const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: { value: 0 },
    reducers: {
      increment: (state) => { state.value += 1; },
      decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1; }
    }
  });
  
  export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
  export default counterSlice.reducer;`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Creating a Zustand Store',
      code: `import { create } from 'zustand';
  
  const useStore = create((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  }));
  
  export default useStore;`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Using Context API for Theme',
      code: `import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';
  
  const ThemeContext = createContext();
  
  export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
    
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
        {children}
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
  
  export function useTheme() {
    return useContext(ThemeContext);
  }`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    'Choosing the right state management approach depends on the complexity and needs of the application. Simple tools like useState and Context API suffice for many projects, while Redux or Zustand are better suited for larger, more dynamic applications requiring global, scalable state management. In Next.js, understanding the server vs. client component distinction is also vital for correct state handling.',
