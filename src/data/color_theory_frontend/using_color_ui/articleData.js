    introduction: `Using color effectively in UI design is more than aesthetic—it is central to usability, emotional engagement, visual hierarchy, accessibility, and brand identity. Colors must function cohesively within a digital product’s layout, state changes, and feedback loops. This article explores the many roles of color in UI—from interaction affordances and functional signals to branding and user personalization.`,

        'Color is a powerful way to reflect system status. Green usually signals success, red for errors, and yellow for caution. These must be paired with icons or text for clarity. States like hover, focus, and disabled need subtle transitions and clarity across themes. Grayscale or opacity is often used for disabled elements.'

    conclusion: `Color in UI design carries immense responsibility—it must inform, guide, delight, and include. Designers and developers must move beyond aesthetic intuition to consider color's behavioral, emotional, and technical dimensions. Using tokenized systems, accessible patterns, and clear hierarchy, teams can ensure their use of color makes interfaces more intuitive and inclusive, not just more beautiful.`
