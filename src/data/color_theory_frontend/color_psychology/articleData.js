    introduction: `Color psychology explores how colors influence human emotions, behaviors, and perceptions — particularly in digital experiences. In frontend development, color is more than aesthetic; it shapes trust, urgency, readability, and user decision-making. This article unpacks the emotional impact of color families, the contextual variance in their interpretation, and the common pitfalls of relying solely on color for communication.`,

    conclusion: `Color psychology gives frontend developers powerful tools to shape how users feel and behave — but these tools must be wielded responsibly. Emotional intent must be harmonized with accessibility, context, and branding. When tested properly and integrated semantically, psychological color use can elevate user interfaces from merely functional to emotionally resonant.`
