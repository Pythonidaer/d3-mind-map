    introduction: `Color spaces and models define how colors are represented, structured, and interpreted by digital systems. Each model has unique characteristics tailored for different use cases, from screen displays to printing to perceptual consistency. Frontend developers must understand these systems to choose and convert colors accurately, maintain consistency across devices, and support accessibility and design precision.`,
