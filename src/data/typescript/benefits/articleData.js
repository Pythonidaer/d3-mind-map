  introduction:
    'TypeScript introduces a range of benefits that significantly improve developer productivity, code safety, maintainability, and the ability to scale across teams and codebases. These advantages make it a powerful tool in modern web development.',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Key Benefits',
    content: [
      '**Code Reliability:** Static typing ensures that potential errors are caught at compile time, before they reach production.',
      "**Improved Tooling:** Rich IDE support, powered by TypeScript's static types, enhances the developer experience.",
      '**Maintainability:** Type annotations act as built-in documentation, making large codebases easier to manage and refactor.',
      '**Early Detection:** Bugs are found earlier in the development process, saving debugging time and improving code quality.',
      "**Scalability:** TypeScript's structure and contracts help teams organize and grow projects efficiently.",
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'IntelliSense and Type Inference',
      code: `interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
  }
  
  const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' };
  // IDE will suggest user.id and user.name automatically`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Static Analysis - Unused Variables',
      code: `function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    const unused = 123; // TypeScript will warn about unused variable
    return a + b;
  }`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Type Contracts Across Modules',
      code: `// types.ts
  export interface Product {
    id: string;
    price: number;
  }
  
  // cart.ts
  import { Product } from './types';
  function addToCart(product: Product) { /* ... */ }`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Refactoring with Safety',
      code: `interface Config {
    timeout: number;
    retries: number;
  }
  
  const config: Config = { timeout: 5000, retries: 3 };
  // If we rename 'retries' to 'attempts', TypeScript and the IDE will catch all references.`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Auto-Documentation via Types',
      code: `interface Settings {
    /** Timeout in milliseconds */
    timeout: number;
    /** Whether to log requests */
    debug: boolean;
  }
  
  function initialize(settings: Settings) {
    // IDE shows comments as tooltips
  }`,
    },
  ],

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      '**Compile-Time Safety:** Prevents common runtime bugs through early detection.',
      '**IntelliSense & Autocomplete:** Speeds up development and reduces typos.',
      '**Refactoring Confidence:** Safely rename, restructure, and reuse code with reliable type checking.',
      '**Cross-Team Collaboration:** Clear interfaces act as communication contracts across teams and services.',
      '**Self-Documenting Code:** Types act as live documentation visible in IDEs during development.',
      '**Static Analysis:** Identifies unreachable code, type mismatches, and other issues automatically.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Drawbacks',
    content: [
      '**Verbose Type Definitions:** Writing types for deeply nested or generic-heavy code can feel tedious.',
      '**Configuration Overhead:** Projects may need build tool adjustments (tsconfig, bundlers, etc.).',
      '**Learning Overhead:** Requires familiarity with typing patterns, especially for new JavaScript devs.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Over-reliance on any:** Disables type checking and weakens TypeScriptâ€™s value.',
      '**Poor Interface Design:** Vague or overly abstract interfaces reduce clarity.',
      '**Ignoring TypeScript Errors:** Silencing or ignoring errors defeats the benefits of static checking.',
    ],
  },

  conclusion:
    'The structured typing system of TypeScript not only improves the safety and clarity of your code but also facilitates team collaboration and long-term project growth. By leaning into its type system, you unlock superior development ergonomics and stability.',
