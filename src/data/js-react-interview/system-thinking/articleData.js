      System thinking helps frontend engineers build features that consider the impact on users, teams, architecture, and operations. This mindset leads to better code quality, long-term maintainability, and reduced risk of unintended side effects.

      title: "Key Areas of System Thinking",
      content: [
        "**User Experience:** Understand how frontend choices affect accessibility, responsiveness, and perceived performance.",
        "**Team & Collaboration:** Ensure your changes are readable, reviewable, and donâ€™t create maintenance debt.",
        "**Dependencies:** Consider how libraries, APIs, and packages evolve and how your app depends on them.",
        "**Architecture & Boundaries:** Encapsulate logic cleanly and avoid leaking responsibilities between modules.",
        "**Observability:** Add the logs, events, and monitoring needed to debug live issues.",
        "**Resilience:** Design for error tolerance, degraded service, and fallback experiences."

          // In Git PR description

      content: [
        "**Prevents Unintended Side Effects:** Think through downstream consequences of changes.",
        "**Improves User Trust:** Fast and resilient interfaces reduce frustration.",
        "**Enhances Maintainability:** Collaborators can understand and update your work more easily.",
        "**Supports Debuggability:** Monitoring and logging help isolate bugs quickly in production.",

      title: "Challenges or Tradeoffs",
      content: [
        "**Takes Extra Time:** Considering all angles (UX, team, fail states) slows initial development.",
        "**Requires Context Sharing:** You must communicate system-wide implications clearly in PRs and meetings.",
        "**Hard to Predict Everything:** Some effects only become obvious after changes go live."

    antiPatterns: {
      title: "Anti-Patterns",
      content: [
        "**No Ownership:** Modifying shared files without understanding who relies on them.",
        "**Large Unreviewable PRs:** Difficult for teammates to understand or validate.",
        "**No Error UI or Logs:** Crashes or silent failures that leave the user confused and the team blind.",
        "**Blindly Upgrading Dependencies:** Breaks compatibility or brings hidden side effects.",
        "**Leaky Architecture:** Mixing concerns or creating tightly coupled components across modules."
      ]

    conclusion: `
      Frontend engineers operate in a complex system of users, platforms, teammates, and infrastructure. Applying system thinking ensures your code fits cleanly into that ecosystem, remains maintainable, and performs well even in failure scenarios.
