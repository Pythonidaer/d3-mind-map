      title: "Key Principles",
      content: [
        "**Clarity & Readability:** Code should clearly express its purpose with thoughtful naming and helpful structure.",
        "**Reusability & DRY:** Avoid duplication by creating reusable components and hooks.",
        "**Performance & Efficiency:** Optimize for fast load and render times using lazy loading, virtualization, and memoization.",
        "**Accessibility (A11y):** Build interfaces that serve all users with appropriate roles, labels, and keyboard support.",
        "**Simplicity & YAGNI:** Avoid complexity until it's truly needed. Favor clear and minimal solutions.",
        "**Scalability & Modularity:** Structure projects so they can grow with feature isolation and folder discipline.",
        "**Testing & Reliability:** Use unit and integration tests to protect code from regressions and ensure reliability.",
        "**Teamwork & Collaboration:** Align on conventions, review code thoughtfully, and share ownership through pair programming and documentation."

      content: [
        "**Improved Maintainability:** Easy to understand and modify over time.",
        "**Reduced Bugs:** Better-tested and modular code has fewer side effects.",
        "**Scalable Codebase:** Clean structure and low coupling help onboard new developers quickly.",

      title: "Challenges or Tradeoffs",
      content: [
        "**Initial Overhead:** Designing for reusability or modularity takes extra planning upfront.",
        "**Testing Discipline:** Writing and maintaining tests takes time and consistent effort.",
        "**Balancing Abstractions:** Over-abstraction or premature patterns can confuse the team."

      title: "Anti-Patterns",
      content: [
        "**Long Functions:** Do too much at once and make debugging difficult.",
        "**Tight Coupling:** Shared logic deeply wired into components makes them hard to change.",
        "**Over-Commenting:** Comments that repeat what code says instead of clarifying intent.",
        "**No Error Boundaries:** Failing to plan for runtime errors.",
        "**Magic Numbers / Strings:** Hard-coded values with no explanation."
