    introduction: `
      Frontend interviews evaluate both technical expertise and collaboration skills. This guide categorizes common frontend interview questions into JavaScript, React, system design, performance, accessibility, and behavioral sectionsâ€”along with tips and code snippets to practice your answers.

        "**Explain Tradeoffs:** When suggesting improvements, mention why you'd use one tool or method over another.",

        "**Too Verbose or Too Quiet:** Strike a balance between explaining and coding.",
        "**Ignoring Edge Cases:** Always consider null, empty, error, or boundary conditions.",
