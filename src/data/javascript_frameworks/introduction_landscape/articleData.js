  introduction:
    'This section provides an overview of the JavaScript framework ecosystem—defining frameworks, exploring why they matter, and tracing their evolution and impact.',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Core Principles',
    content: [
      'Framework Definition: A structured foundation offering reusable components, lifecycle hooks, and enforced conventions for building applications efficiently.',
      'Inversion of Control: Frameworks manage the application loop, invoking user-defined callbacks and lifecycle methods rather than the application driving the framework.',
      'Opinionated Structure: Frameworks prescribe project organization (file layout, component boundaries) to maintain consistency across teams.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits of Framework Adoption',
    content: [
      'Rapid Scaffolding: CLI tools generate boilerplate (e.g., create-react-app, vue-cli) so you can focus on features immediately.',
      'Consistent Architecture: Uniform patterns and folder structures ease onboarding and maintenance.',
      'Built-In Optimizations: Virtual DOM diffing (React), compile-time code splitting (Svelte), and AOT compilation (Angular) improve performance.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Challenges & Drawbacks',
    content: [
      'Learning Overhead: Developers must grasp framework-specific syntax (JSX, directives, decorators).',
      'Upgrade Friction: Major version changes (e.g., Angular v8→v9) can require rewriting parts of your code.',
      'Ecosystem Fatigue: Frequent new releases and competing frameworks can fragment your toolchain.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      'Framework Shopping: Switching frameworks every year without mastering one reduces productivity.',
      'Overkill for Simple Sites: Using heavy SPA frameworks for static or minimally interactive pages.',
      'Ignoring Native APIs: Leaping to framework-specific solutions without considering built-in browser capabilities.',
    ],
  },

  conclusion:
    'With these fundamentals in place, you’re ready to explore individual frameworks—understanding their unique features, paradigms, and when to choose each.',
