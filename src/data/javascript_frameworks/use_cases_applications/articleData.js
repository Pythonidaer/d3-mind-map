  introduction:
    'JavaScript frameworks and libraries serve a wide range of use cases, from static personal sites to dynamic single-page apps and enterprise dashboards. Choosing the right tool and architecture starts with identifying your goals, scale, and expected user experience.',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Project Types and When to Use What',
    content: [
      'Static Sites: Best for fast-loading, SEO-focused websites with little to no dynamic interaction. Consider Eleventy, Astro, or a bare HTML/CSS/JS stack.',
      'Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Ideal for complex frontends with lots of client-side interactivity, form flows, or authenticated user sessions. Often built with React, Vue, or Angular.',
      'Server-Side Rendered (SSR) Apps: Best for apps that need dynamic data but also care about SEO or fast first paint. Consider frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js.',
      'Dashboards & Admin Panels: Ideal use case for component libraries and data visualizations. Combine SPA frameworks with Chart.js, D3.js, or Material UI.',
      'Hybrid Apps: Best when your app has a mix of needs — fast load, rich interaction, dynamic routing. Frameworks like Next.js allow hybrid SSR + SSG + SPA components.',
      'Mobile Web / PWAs: When you want a responsive, installable experience with offline support and fast interaction. Consider Preact, React with Workbox, or Ionic + Angular.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Missteps to Avoid When Matching Tech to Use Case',
    content: [
      'Wrong Tool for the Job: Don’t build a portfolio site with React + Redux if all you need is HTML, Tailwind, and a little Alpine.js.',
      'Misusing PWA Techniques: Don’t implement service workers unless you have real offline needs. Improper use leads to stale caches and more bugs.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Minimal Static Site (No Framework)',
      code: `<!-- index.html -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head><title>About Me</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>This is a personal portfolio. No framework needed.</p>
  </body>
  </html>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'React SPA Entry Point',
      code: `// index.js (SPA root)
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
  import App from './App';
  
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
  root.render(<App />);`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Next.js Hybrid App Page',
      code: `// pages/blog/[slug].js
  export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    return { props: { slug: context.params.slug } };
  }
  
  export default function BlogPost({ slug }) {
    return <article>Post: {slug}</article>;
  }`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    'Choosing between libraries, frameworks, SPAs, SSR, or static sites depends entirely on your goals. Ask yourself: Does my app need dynamic routing or static routing? Will users log in? Do I care about SEO? Will the content update in real time or stay fixed? Do I need fast initial load or a highly interactive experience? Keep it simple when you can — libraries and vanilla JS are powerful. Use frameworks when they solve real pain points, not by default.',
