  introduction:
    'Hybrid Rendering is an architectural approach where different rendering strategies — Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), Client-Side Rendering (CSR), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) — are intelligently combined within a single web application to optimize for performance, SEO, and user experience based on specific page requirements.',

    title: 'Core Principles of Hybrid Rendering',
    content: [
      "**Render Per Use Case:** Choose the rendering method that best suits each page's content, update frequency, and SEO needs.",
      '**Flexible Architecture:** Allow different parts of the app to use different strategies without conflicts.',
      "**Optimized Delivery:** Minimize load times and maximize user experience by matching the rendering strategy to the page's role.",
    ],

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      '**Page-Specific Optimization:** Static generation for marketing pages, server-side rendering for SEO-critical dynamic pages, and client-side rendering for highly interactive dashboards.',
      '**Balanced Performance and Scalability:** Hybrid setups allow tailoring infrastructure usage without overloading servers or forcing rebuilds.',
      '**Improved Developer Agility:** Developers can optimize individual routes or components without needing to redesign the whole architecture.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Drawbacks',
    content: [
      '**Increased Complexity:** Managing multiple rendering flows requires disciplined architecture and careful separation of concerns.',
      '**Deployment Challenges:** Deployments must handle routing and caching strategies correctly across different rendering types.',
      '**Potential SEO Inconsistencies:** Mistakes in deciding which pages to SSR versus SSG can lead to indexing or ranking problems if misunderstood.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Blindly Mixing Strategies:** Randomly mixing SSR, SSG, and CSR without clear reasons leads to messy architectures and poor performance.',
      '**Static for Highly Dynamic Content:** Using SSG for constantly changing content forces frequent rebuilds, defeating its purpose.',
      '**Ignoring Fallback Behavior:** Not setting correct fallbacks for dynamic paths during hybrid generation can break navigation and SEO.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Next.js Hybrid Rendering Example',
      code: `
  // Example of mixing getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and CSR in Next.js
  
  // getStaticProps (SSG) - Marketing Homepage
  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/home');
    const data = await res.json();
    return { props: { data }, revalidate: 3600 }; // ISR every hour
  }
  
  // getServerSideProps (SSR) - Product Detail Page
  export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const res = await fetch(\`https://api.example.com/products/\${context.params.id}\`);
    const product = await res.json();
    return { props: { product } };
  }
  
  // Client-Side Fetching (CSR) - User Dashboard
  import useSWR from 'swr';
  
  function Dashboard() {
    const { data } = useSWR('/api/user-dashboard', url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json()));
  
    if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    return <div>Welcome, {data.username}</div>;
  }
  
  export default Dashboard;
  
  // Each page optimally chooses its rendering strategy based on its needs
  `,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    'Hybrid Rendering is a powerful and increasingly necessary pattern in modern web development. By combining SSG, SSR, CSR, and ISR intelligently, developers can create applications that are fast, SEO-friendly, and highly interactive. However, success with hybrid rendering requires thoughtful planning, clear architectural rules, and a strong understanding of when each strategy excels. As frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js continue evolving, hybrid rendering is becoming the de facto standard for scaling modern web apps across diverse use cases.',
