  introduction:
    'Hydration is the crucial process that makes static HTML rendered by Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) fully interactive on the client side. It attaches event listeners, restores application state, and reactivates dynamic behaviors by reusing the server-rendered HTML.',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Core Principles of Hydration',
    content: [
      '**Attach Event Listeners:** Hydration binds JavaScript logic, like click handlers and form events, to the existing static HTML structure.',
      '**Restore Application State:** Hydration ensures that any server-rendered data or component state is accessible to the client JavaScript application.',
      '**Efficient Client Activation:** Hydration tries to reuse DOM elements rather than replacing them, minimizing layout shifts and reflows.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      '**Immediate Content Display:** Users can see meaningful content almost immediately before JavaScript loads.',
      '**Interactive Upgrade:** Static HTML becomes fully dynamic without needing a second render from scratch.',
      '**SEO Preservation:** Search engines can index the server-rendered content, while hydration enhances user interactivity afterward.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Drawbacks',
    content: [
      '**Hydration Mismatches:** If the client-side rendered DOM differs from the server-rendered HTML, it can cause warnings or re-renders.',
      '**JavaScript Overhead:** Large bundles or inefficient hydration strategies can still lead to delayed interactivity, especially on slow devices.',
      '**Complex Debugging:** Hydration issues often involve intricate problems around server-client consistency and state management.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      "**Full Rehydration for Static Components:** Rehydrating sections that don't need interactivity wastes bandwidth and delays Time to Interactive.",
      '**Blocking Hydration:** Loading huge JavaScript bundles or critical data synchronously can stall hydration, causing a poor user experience.',
      '**Ignoring Streaming or Partial Hydration:** Not using modern hydration techniques when applicable increases the main-thread workload unnecessarily.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'React Hydration Example with hydrateRoot',
      code: `
  import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
  import App from './App';
  
  const container = document.getElementById('root');
  
  hydrateRoot(container, <App />);
  
  // hydrateRoot reuses the existing server-rendered HTML and attaches React event listeners.
  // This avoids discarding DOM and provides immediate interactivity.
  `,
    },
    {
      title: 'Vue.js Hydration Example (Client Mount)',
      code: `
  import { createSSRApp, createApp } from 'vue';
  import App from './App.vue';
  
  const app = createSSRApp(App);
  app.mount('#app');
  
  // Vue compares the server-rendered HTML to its virtual DOM tree and attaches reactivity.
  // No need to recreate the DOM nodes â€” Vue "hydrates" them instead.
  `,
    },
    {
      title: 'Angular Hydration Example (provideClientHydration)',
      code: `
  // main.ts
  import { bootstrapApplication, provideClientHydration } from '@angular/platform-browser';
  import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';
  
  bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
    providers: [provideClientHydration()]
  });
  
  // Angular uses provideClientHydration to reuse the server-rendered HTML and attach Angular component functionality.
  // This prevents unnecessary re-renders after loading.
  `,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    'Hydration is the bridge between static server-rendered content and fully interactive client-side applications. It ensures fast perceived performance, supports SEO, and enables rich user experiences. However, poorly managed hydration can introduce significant performance bottlenecks. Modern web development increasingly relies on advanced hydration techniques, such as partial hydration, progressive hydration, and streaming, to minimize JavaScript execution overhead and prioritize critical interactivity. Mastering hydration patterns allows developers to balance SEO, performance, and rich interactivity across diverse web application architectures.',
