  introduction:
    'Streaming Rendering is a technique where the server progressively sends pieces of HTML to the browser as they become available, rather than waiting for the full page to be generated. This approach improves perceived performance and enables faster Time to First Paint (TTFP).',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Core Principles of Streaming Rendering',
    content: [
      '**Chunked HTML Delivery:** Instead of sending a complete page, HTML is streamed in parts to the browser.',
      '**Progressive User Experience:** Users can start interacting with visible parts of the page while the rest loads.',
      '**Server and Browser Collaboration:** Streaming requires smart coordination between the server sending chunks and the browser progressively rendering them.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      '**Faster Time to First Paint (TTFP):** Critical content can be displayed almost immediately, improving perceived load speed.',
      '**Progressive Loading:** Non-essential content can be deferred, reducing the main-thread blocking and speeding up interactivity.',
      '**Better User Experience on Slow Connections:** Streaming minimizes "white screen" delays for users with slow networks or devices.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Drawbacks',
    content: [
      '**Increased Server Complexity:** Setting up streaming requires special server logic to manage partial responses.',
      '**Potential for Inconsistent States:** Poorly managed streaming can lead to confusing UX if important content appears too late or out of order.',
      '**Caching Challenges:** Streaming dynamic chunks complicates traditional caching strategies at CDNs or proxy layers.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Streaming Everything:** Streaming too much non-critical content early can defeat the purpose of improving perceived speed.',
      '**Poor Loading Priority:** Failing to prioritize key visual elements during streaming harms user trust and perceived responsiveness.',
      '**No Fallback Strategies:** Not providing fallback loading skeletons or placeholders can make the progressive load feel broken.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'React 18 Streaming SSR Example',
      code: `
  import { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';
  import express from 'express';
  import App from './App';
  
  const app = express();
  
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {
      onShellReady() {
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
        pipe(res); // Start streaming immediately
      },
      onError(err) {
        console.error(err);
      },
    });
  });
  
  app.listen(3000);
  
  // Server progressively streams HTML to the client as React components render
  `,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    "Streaming Rendering enhances the perceived speed of web applications by sending HTML to the browser as soon as it's available. By allowing critical parts of the page to appear earlier, developers can greatly improve user satisfaction and engagement. However, careful priority management and progressive enhancement strategies are essential to avoid UX pitfalls. As modern frameworks increasingly support streaming by default, understanding how to leverage it effectively will be a key skill for performance-focused web development.",
