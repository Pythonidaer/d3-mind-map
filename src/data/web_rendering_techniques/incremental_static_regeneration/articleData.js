    'Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables developers to update static content after deployment without rebuilding the entire site. Pages are regenerated in the background as traffic comes in, allowing a seamless blend of static site performance with dynamic content updating.',

  keyPrinciples: {
    title: 'Core Principles of ISR',
    content: [
      '**Per-Page Regeneration:** Individual static pages can be updated without rebuilding the entire site.',
      '**On-Demand Updates:** Pages are revalidated based on defined time intervals or user triggers.',
      '**Background Generation:** New page versions are built asynchronously without blocking users.',
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits',
    content: [
      '**Fresh Content Without Full Rebuilds:** You can keep content up-to-date without needing a complete site build and redeploy.',
      '**Reduced Build Times:** Large sites can generate pages only when needed, drastically shortening build durations.',
      '**High Scalability:** Static assets are updated efficiently while maintaining CDN-level scalability and low hosting costs.',
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Drawbacks',
    content: [
      '**Potential Stale Content:** Visitors may briefly see outdated content until a new page is regenerated and cached.',
      '**Complex Caching Logic:** Developers must carefully manage revalidation timings and caching strategies to avoid inconsistencies.',
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
    content: [
      '**Overusing ISR for Rapidly Changing Data:** Highly dynamic data should use SSR or APIs, not ISR, to avoid frequent rebuilds.',
      '**Incorrect Revalidation Timing:** Setting overly aggressive revalidation intervals can stress backend resources and cause inconsistencies.',
      '**No Cache Invalidation Strategy:** Without thoughtful cache controls, users might experience stale or conflicting page versions.',
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Next.js ISR Example with revalidate',
      code: `
  import React from 'react';
  
  // getStaticProps runs at build time, and then allows revalidation at runtime
  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
    const posts = await res.json();
  
    return {
      props: { posts },
      revalidate: 60, // Regenerate the page at most once every 60 seconds
    };
  }
  
  const Blog = ({ posts }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
  
  export default Blog;
  
  // This page is pre-rendered at build time and updated periodically without needing a redeploy
  `,
    },
  ],

  conclusion:
    'Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) revolutionizes static site workflows by offering a dynamic, scalable, and flexible update model. Developers no longer need to choose between fully static or fully dynamic â€” ISR provides the best of both worlds. By mastering when and how to apply revalidation intelligently, teams can optimize build speed, content freshness, and user experience without sacrificing scalability.',
