  introduction: `The Security tab in Chrome DevTools offers an essential toolkit for assessing the security posture of a web application. It enables developers to inspect HTTPS configurations, validate certificates, detect mixed content, analyze Content Security Policy (CSP) issues, and verify HTTP security headers, ensuring user data and interactions are protected.`,

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'View Certificate Details',

  // Click "View Certificate" > Inspect issuer, expiration, and trust chain`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Identify Mixed Content',
      code: `// Security tab > Look for "mixed content" warnings
  // Expand warnings to see specific resources loaded insecurely`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Check HSTS Header',
      code: `// In Network tab
  // Inspect response headers
  // Look for "Strict-Transport-Security" directive`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Find CSP Violations',
      code: `// Open Security panel
  // Review "Content Security Policy" issues section
  // Identify blocked scripts or unauthorized sources`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `The Security tab empowers developers to build safer websites by offering clear visibility into HTTPS implementation, certificate trust chains, mixed content vulnerabilities, security header enforcement, and CSP effectiveness. By integrating regular security audits into development workflows, developers can significantly enhance user trust and protect applications from common attack vectors.`,
