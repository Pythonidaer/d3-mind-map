      title: 'Edit a Step',
      code: `// In Recorder panel
  // Click step > Edit selector or action properties`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Measure Flow Performance',
      code: `// Open Recorder panel
  // Select a recording > Click "Measure performance"
  // Analyze generated trace in Performance tab`,

      title: 'Import a Recording',
      code: `// Recorder > Import > Choose .json file
  // Load flow for editing or replay`,
