    conclusion:
      "Integrating accessibility into the development lifecycle means building it into culture, not just code. Teams that prioritize accessibility early and often avoid expensive retrofits and create more usable products for everyone. From product vision to post-launch updates, inclusive design must be a shared responsibility across disciplines—planned, practiced, and preserved through iteration."
