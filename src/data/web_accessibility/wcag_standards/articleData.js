      "The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the international standard for creating accessible digital content. Developed by the W3C, these guidelines are based on four core principles—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). WCAG provides a structured, testable, and widely adopted framework for ensuring that websites and applications can be used by people with a wide range of disabilities. Understanding its structure, evolution, and the meaning of each principle is foundational to implementing effective accessibility.",

    conclusion:
      "Understanding WCAG and the POUR principles is essential for any accessibility initiative. These guidelines provide both a philosophical foundation and a practical framework for designing accessible content. By internalizing the POUR principles—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust—developers and organizations can move beyond checklist compliance and toward truly inclusive, effective design. Accessibility is not only a requirement—it's a responsibility and an opportunity to make the web better for everyone."
