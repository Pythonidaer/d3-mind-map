    introduction:
      "The WCAG Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is a structured approach for determining how well a website conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Developed by the W3C, it provides clarity, consistency, and credibility to accessibility audits. WCAG-EM helps organizations move beyond ad-hoc testing toward systematic conformance evaluation that can be replicated and reported across large teams or regulatory settings.",

        "It brings structure and consistency to accessibility testing.",
        "It ensures representative content and critical flows are evaluated.",

        "Optionally, summarize overall conformance with a declaration (e.g., 'This site conforms to WCAG 2.2 Level AA, with exceptions noted in the findings').",

    conclusion:
      "The WCAG-EM process transforms accessibility evaluation into a rigorous, repeatable methodology. By defining scope, selecting a sample, auditing thoroughly, and reporting with precision, organizations can move beyond superficial compliance and demonstrate serious commitment to digital inclusion. Whether preparing for legal review, public accountability, or internal quality assurance, WCAG-EM offers a robust framework for lasting accessibility impact."
