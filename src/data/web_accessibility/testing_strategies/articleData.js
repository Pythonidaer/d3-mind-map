      "Testing for accessibility requires more than running automated scans. A comprehensive evaluation strategy blends automated tools, manual inspection, and usability testing with people who rely on assistive technologies. This hybrid model ensures both technical conformance and real-world usability, providing a more inclusive and legally defensible web experience.",

    conclusion:
      "Accessibility testing is an ongoing process—not a one-time event.

WCAG-EM provides a gold-standard framework for audits, but the real goal is continuous, human-centered improvement."
