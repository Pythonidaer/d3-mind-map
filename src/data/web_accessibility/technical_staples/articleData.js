      "Technical staples form the backbone of accessible web development. These practices aren't just about compliance—they are about ensuring your digital experiences are usable, inclusive, and robust for people of all abilities. This article explores the essential coding patterns and interface behaviors that drive conformance with WCAG, particularly Level AA, while offering a more inclusive user experience for everyone.",

      content: [
        "Use semantic HTML elements instead of generic containers.",
        "Provide alt text and media alternatives for non-text content.",
        "Ensure full keyboard operability with visible focus indicators.",
        "Maintain minimum contrast ratios for all visual content.",
        "Label all forms and manage errors with assistive clarity.",
        "Use ARIA only when necessary and correctly implemented.",
        "Support responsive layouts and text zoom without breaking content.",
        "Structure pages with skip links, landmarks, and heading hierarchy."

      title: "Semantic HTML",
      content: [
        "Semantic elements like `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` provide meaning and structure that assistive technologies rely on.",
        "Proper heading levels (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) create a navigable outline of the page.",
        "Avoid using `<div>` and `<span>` where semantic elements are more appropriate."
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_text_alternatives: {
      title: "Text Alternatives",
      content: [
        "Provide `alt` attributes for all meaningful images. If an image is decorative, use `alt=\"\"`.",
        "All audio and video content must have synchronized captions and/or transcripts.",
        "Audio descriptions are required for videos when key visual details aren't conveyed by the audio alone."

    deepDive_keyboard_navigation: {
      title: "Keyboard Navigation",
      content: [
        "Every interactive element—buttons, links, forms—must be operable using the keyboard alone.",
        "Use logical focus order that matches the reading order of the page.",
        "Ensure modals and dialogs do not trap focus, and provide a clear way to return to the main content.",
        "Apply visible focus styles to all focusable elements to guide users who rely on keyboard navigation."
      ]

    deepDive_color_contrast: {
      title: "Color & Contrast",
      content: [
        "Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background for normal text and 3:1 for large text.",
        "Non-text elements like icons, form borders, and buttons must also meet a 3:1 contrast ratio.",
        "Never use color alone to convey information (e.g., red = error). Use icons, patterns, or text labels in addition."
      ]

    deepDive_accessible_forms: {
      title: "Accessible Forms",
      content: [
        "Use `<label for=\"...\">` to ensure every form control is explicitly labeled.",
        "Include clear instructions when user input requires specific formatting or values.",
        "Show error messages in text near the problematic field and associate them programmatically with `aria-describedby`.",
        "When known, provide suggestions to help users correct errors (e.g., 'Did you mean...?')."
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_aria_usage: {
      title: "ARIA Usage",
      content: [
        "Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) only when native HTML cannot fulfill the same function.",
        "Do not override the semantic role of a native element unless absolutely necessary.",
        "Avoid common ARIA pitfalls like hiding visible interactive elements (`aria-hidden=\"true\"`), or assigning roles that conflict with the element's default behavior.",
        "If you implement a custom widget (e.g., slider, tab panel), use ARIA to define roles, states, and keyboard behaviors properly—and test with screen readers."
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_responsive_zoom: {
      title: "Zoom, Resize & Reflow",
      content: [
        "All content must be readable at 200% text zoom and 400% page zoom without loss of content or functionality.",
        "Avoid layouts that require horizontal scrolling—especially on small viewports like mobile devices.",
        "Use relative units like `em`, `rem`, or percentages instead of fixed pixel values to allow resizing and reflowing.",
        "Ensure that key controls and layouts adapt when zoomed or in reduced-width windows."
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_multimedia_accessibility: {
      title: "Multimedia Accessibility",
      content: [
        "Pre-recorded videos must have synchronized captions and optionally an audio description track.",
        "Live video content (e.g., webinars) should offer real-time captioning if AA conformance is desired.",
        "All audio and video content should have an accompanying transcript that describes all speech and relevant audio cues.",
        "Ensure videos with dialogue also describe important visual elements that are not conveyed through narration."
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_page_structure: {
      title: "Page Structure & Skip Links",
      content: [
        "Each page must begin with a `<title>` element that accurately reflects its purpose.",
        "Use a single `<h1>` as the page's main heading, followed by correctly nested headings to reflect the content structure.",
        "Landmark elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) help users quickly jump to key regions of a page using assistive technologies.",
        "Provide a 'skip to main content' link at the top of each page to allow keyboard users to bypass navigation menus and jump directly to the primary content."
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion:
      "Technical accessibility is not about retrofitting fixes but building access into your development process from the ground up. By adopting semantic structure, responsive design, keyboard support, and proper labeling, you're not only complying with WCAG—you're creating an inclusive experience for all users. These staples should be standard practice, embedded into every project’s planning, design, and development cycles."
