      `Authentication and authorization are not just functional requirements — they are critical security pillars of any application. 
  Overlooking best practices can lead to devastating breaches, from unauthorized access to stolen identities and corrupted sessions. 
  This article compiles the most important best practices into a concise reference for designing and maintaining secure auth systems. 
  Each practice is rooted in real-world incidents, defensive design, and industry recommendations for long-term reliability and resilience.`,

      content: [
        'Every authentication system must resist impersonation, token abuse, and brute-force attacks.',
        'Authorization decisions must be enforced server-side — UI logic alone is never enough.',
        'Sessions and tokens must be securely stored, rotated, and expired to protect against hijacking.',
        'Minimal trust and maximum accountability should drive all permission models — default to deny.',
        'Security is not a one-time setup. It’s a process of monitoring, logging, and improvement.',

        'Lays a solid foundation for scaling your app securely without rewriting core infrastructure.',
        'Builds user trust by protecting credentials, sessions, and role-based data visibility.',

        'Misconfigurations in third-party auth libraries (e.g., cookie flags, token leaks) are common.',

        title: 'Example: Enforcing Least Privilege in Express Middleware',
        code: `function requireRole(role) {
    return (req, res, next) => {
      if (!req.user || req.user.role !== role) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });

        code: `logEvent({
    userId: req.user?.id,

    conclusion:
      `If you follow no other guidelines in application development, follow these. 
  Auth and access control sit at the boundary between users and your most sensitive functionality — if they are weak, nothing else matters.
  
  Implement strong hashing and salting for passwords. Store tokens securely with the right cookie flags. Enforce permissions at the backend. Rotate tokens and monitor authentication events. Grant only what’s needed — and nothing more.
  
  These aren’t optional enhancements — they are the baseline. 
  They protect your team, your users, and your business from becoming tomorrow’s cautionary tale.
  
  Security doesn’t come from intention. It comes from habit. And best practices, when followed systematically, become your strongest habit of all.`,
