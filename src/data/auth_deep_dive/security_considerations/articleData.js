    introduction:
      `Authentication and authorization are prime targets for attackers because they represent the front gates of your application. 
  Even if your app is beautifully built and performs flawlessly, a single mistake in access control or session handling can lead to catastrophic data exposure or account takeovers. 
  This article outlines the most critical security considerations for auth systems, organized by risk category — including token abuse, role misvalidation, phishing, and dangerous misconfigurations — with practical insights to help developers avoid costly mistakes.`,

      content: [
        'Authentication systems are attractive targets for brute-force attacks, phishing, and token theft — always design for adversarial conditions.',
        'Authorization must never rely solely on frontend behavior or user trust. Backend validation is non-negotiable.',
        'Tokens, sessions, and cookies are attack surfaces. They must be stored, transmitted, and validated with precision.',
        'Default misconfigurations are one of the most common sources of breach — developers must proactively harden every auth surface.',
        'Social engineering attacks often bypass technical defenses — user awareness and minimal trust by default are essential.',

      title: 'Why These Risks Are Often Overlooked',
      content: [
        'Auth implementations are often rushed or copied from templates without fully understanding security implications.',
        'Developers underestimate the importance of verifying token signatures, expiration, or access scope.',
        'Complexity increases with third-party providers, leading to gaps in session lifecycle or role enforcement.',
        'Security is often seen as a “backend problem,” while frontend teams might unknowingly introduce risk (e.g., storing tokens in localStorage).',
      ],

    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Real-World Security Mistakes to Avoid',
      content: [
        'Relying on hidden buttons or routes in the frontend to restrict access — backend APIs must validate permissions independently.',
        'Trusting user roles stored in localStorage or unvalidated tokens, allowing spoofing or escalation.',
        'Skipping token signature validation on the server — attackers can forge JWTs with modified payloads.',
        'Allowing password reset or verification flows without expiration or user linkage, enabling takeover.',
        'Using HTTP instead of HTTPS in staging or production, exposing login credentials in transit.',
      ],

      {
        title: 'Example: Validating JWT Signature and Expiration (Node.js)',
        code: `import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
  
  function verifyToken(token) {
    try {
      const payload = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
      return payload;
    } catch (err) {
      return null; // Invalid, expired, or tampered token
    }

        title: 'Example: Setting Secure Cookie with SameSite and HTTPS',
        code: `res.cookie('session', token, {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: true,
    sameSite: 'Strict',
    maxAge: 3600000,
  });`,
      },
      {
        title: 'Example: Role Validation in Protected Route',
        code: `function requireRole(role) {
    return (req, res, next) => {
      if (!req.user || req.user.role !== role) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
      }
      next();
    };
  }
  
  app.get('/admin/data', authenticateUser, requireRole('admin'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Sensitive data');
  });`,
      },
    ],
  
    conclusion:
      `Every authentication system — whether it uses JWTs, sessions, OAuth, or custom credentials — faces a set of known, repeatable risks. 
  Credential stuffing, token theft, CSRF, and frontend-only authorization logic are among the most common causes of real-world breaches. 
  Security doesn’t happen by accident. It requires planning, testing, and constant attention to detail.
  
  Developers must treat auth flows as their highest-priority surface — because attackers do. 
  Never trust client-side state, never skip token validation, and never leave endpoints unguarded based on assumptions about the user.
  
  By thinking adversarially, enforcing security at every layer, and validating every assumption, you can build systems that are resilient, auditable, and capable of withstanding modern attacks. 
  Authentication and authorization aren't just login screens — they're your application’s armor.`,
