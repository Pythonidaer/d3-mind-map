    introduction:
      `This article introduces the foundational concepts of Authentication and Authorization in full-stack JavaScript development. 
  Understanding how users are verified and how their permissions are managed is critical for building secure, scalable applications. 
  This overview explains the differences between authentication and authorization, explores storage methods, protocols, and common anti-patterns, 
  and sets the stage for deeper dives into implementation strategies across frameworks like NextAuth.js and Google Auth.`,

      content: [
        'Authentication verifies identity — ensuring the user is who they claim to be.',
        'Authorization governs access — defining what actions an authenticated user can take.',
        'Authentication always occurs before authorization in the flow of access control.',
        'Tokens or sessions are used to persist user identity between requests.',
        'Token storage location has significant security implications.',
        'OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are modern protocol foundations for secure identity systems.',
        'Frontend logic may adjust the user interface, but true security decisions must occur on the backend.'

      title: 'Benefits of Understanding Core Concepts',
      content: [
        'Establishes a solid foundation for secure application architecture.',
        'Prevents common vulnerabilities like broken access control and token leakage.',
        'Enables confident integration of modern auth tools like NextAuth.js, Firebase Auth, or custom JWT systems.',
        'Improves collaboration between frontend and backend teams through shared mental models.',
        'Prepares developers to handle enterprise-grade identity use cases, including role hierarchies and fine-grained permissions.',

        'Misunderstanding the distinction between authentication and authorization leads to insecure systems.',
        'Managing tokens across distributed systems can introduce complexity.',
        'OAuth and OpenID Connect have steep learning curves despite their power.',

    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Common Anti-Patterns',
      content: [
        'Storing authentication tokens in localStorage — exposes them to XSS attacks.',
        'Relying solely on frontend UI to restrict access — easily bypassed with client-side inspection or script modification.',
        'Hardcoding roles or permissions in frontend logic — makes maintenance fragile and insecure.',
        'Skipping verification of ID tokens from third-party providers — can lead to account spoofing.',
      ],
    },
  
    codeExamples: [
      {
        title: 'Token-Based Authentication: Sending JWT with Fetch',
        code: `fetch('/api/protected', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {

        title: 'Enforcing Backend Authorization in Next.js API Route',
        code: `import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react';
  
  export default async function handler(req, res) {
    const session = await getSession({ req });
    if (!session || session.user.role !== 'admin') {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
    }
  
    res.status(200).json({ data: 'Secure content' });
  }`,
      },
      {
        title: 'Safe Token Storage with Secure, HTTP-Only Cookies (Next.js + NextAuth)',
        code: `// next-auth stores tokens in HTTP-only cookies by default
  // nothing special needed in client-side code
  import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react';
  
  export default function Dashboard() {
    const { data: session } = useSession();
  
    if (!session) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    return <h1>Welcome, {session.user.name}</h1>;
  }`,
      },
    ],
  
    conclusion:
      `Authentication and Authorization form the security backbone of any application that involves user access. 
  Knowing how they differ, when they occur, and how to securely manage sessions and tokens is essential for any developer working 
  on modern web applications. This foundational knowledge empowers you to select the right tools, enforce robust access control, 
  and protect your users’ data with confidence.`,
