  introduction:
    "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the corresponding code. In practice, for each new feature or function, you first write a test that defines what it should do, watch that test fail, then write the minimal code to make it pass, and finally refactor the code. This red-green-refactor cycle is repeated for each small piece of functionality. TDD is as much about design (driving how you structure code) as it is about testing.",

    content: [
      "**Red-Green-Refactor cycle:** TDD is executed in short cycles. First, create a failing test (red). Next, implement just enough code to make that test pass (green). Then, clean up the code (refactor) while ensuring tests still pass. This cycle is the heartbeat of TDD, often only minutes apart for each tiny increment.",
      "**Write test first:** In TDD, you never write new functionality without a test guiding it. The test is written based on requirements/specs. This flips the usual workflow – instead of coding something and then testing, you test an expected behavior and let that dictate the code you write.",
      "**One test at a time:** You focus on one scenario at a time. You don’t write a bunch of tests that all fail; just one failing test is enough to start. Once it passes (and you’ve refactored), you move on to the next small test. This keeps you laser-focused and prevents being overwhelmed by failures.",
      "**Minimal code to pass:** Only write the simplest code that satisfies the test. For example, if the test expects `f(2,3)` to return 5, you might just return 5 as a constant to get green. This seems silly, but it ensures you don't write more code than needed. Future tests will force the general solution. This discipline prevents over-engineering and keeps the codebase lean.",
      "**Refactoring with safety:** After making the test pass, the refactor step is crucial. You improve the code structure (remove duplication, clarify logic) with confidence because tests act as a safety net. In TDD, clean code is a built-in goal, not something optional. Skipping refactoring accumulates technical debt despite having tests."

    {
      title: "TDD Cycle Example",
      code: `// Example of one TDD cycle for a sum function

// Red: Write a failing test
function add(a, b) {
  // (deliberately empty or trivial implementation)
}

// Test (using a simple assert style)
console.assert(add(2, 3) === 5, 'Expected 2 + 3 to equal 5');
// This test fails since add() returns undefined.

// Green: Implement minimal code to pass the test
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
// Now the test passes (2 + 3 === 5).

// Refactor: Nothing needed here, but in complex code you'd clean up.

    title: "Benefits",
    content: [
      "**Improved design & maintainability:** TDD leads to cleaner, modular code. Writing tests first encourages low coupling and high cohesion, as you naturally design for testability. This often includes injecting dependencies rather than hard-coding them, improving architecture.",
      "**Built-in regression suite:** By writing tests for every new piece of functionality, you organically build a comprehensive regression suite without needing extra time or effort. These tests protect against future regressions.",
      "**Refactoring confidence:** Because tests are in place, you can refactor code with confidence. If anything breaks, a failing test will tell you immediately. This makes continuous improvement part of your workflow.",
      "**Reduced debugging time:** With small, testable units and rapid feedback from failing tests, you often fix problems within minutes of introducing them. It shortens bug-fixing cycles and improves overall productivity.",
      "**Better understanding of requirements:** Writing a test forces you to clarify what your code is supposed to do. It highlights edge cases and makes you think from the user or API consumer’s perspective."
    ]
  },

  cons: {
    title: "Drawbacks",
    content: [
      "**Steep learning curve & mindset shift:** TDD requires discipline and a different way of thinking. Many developers aren’t used to writing tests first, and breaking work into small, testable units takes practice.",
      "**Not universally applicable:** TDD may not be ideal for UI-heavy development, exploratory prototyping, or algorithms you haven’t designed yet. In such cases, it's common to prototype and then add tests later.",
      "**Maintenance of tests:** TDD adds test maintenance to your workload. Poorly written tests may be too tightly coupled to implementation and break during refactors. Good TDD tests focus on behavior, not structure.",
      "**Perceived slowdown:** Writing both tests and code can feel slower initially. The productivity gain comes later through fewer bugs, easier maintenance, and faster debugging — but this tradeoff must be accepted.",
      "**False confidence if tests are wrong:** TDD ensures your code matches your tests — but if your tests are based on incorrect assumptions or specs, your code will still be wrong. You must validate the tests themselves."
    ]
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: "Anti-Patterns",
    content: [
      "**Writing multiple tests before coding:** TDD should be incremental. Writing all tests first and then coding undermines the tight feedback loop and often leads to over-engineering.",
      "**Skipping refactor phase:** Doing only Red-Green without Refactor accumulates messy code. The full cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) is essential to reap the design and maintainability benefits.",
      "**Over-mocking everything:** Excessive mocking, especially of internal logic, leads to brittle tests that mirror implementation too closely. Use mocks for true external dependencies, not to simulate every interaction.",
      "**Writing code before tests and calling it TDD:** This reverses the discipline. TDD is about driving design through tests. Writing tests after coding is still useful, but it’s not TDD.",
      "**TDD at the wrong level (e.g., UI or E2E only):** TDD is most effective at the unit level. Using it exclusively for integration or UI testing dilutes its speed and clarity. Consider combining ATDD for broad features with TDD for units."
    ]
  },

  conclusion:
    "TDD is a powerful methodology for building reliable and maintainable JavaScript applications. It encourages better design, reduces bugs, and provides confidence to refactor. While not suited to every situation, teams that invest in TDD often see long-term benefits in agility, code quality, and collaboration. As with any discipline, consistency and thoughtful practice are key to making it effective."
