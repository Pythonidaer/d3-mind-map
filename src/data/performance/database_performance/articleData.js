    introduction: `Database performance is a crucial part of web application speed and scalability. Even with optimized frontend and backend code, a slow or inefficient database can bottleneck the entire system. This article outlines key strategies for improving query performance, indexing data effectively, designing schemas for scalability, and choosing the right type of database. We also cover common pitfalls that cause slowdowns.`,

        'Using SELECT * when only a few columns are needed.',
        'Relying on functions (e.g., LOWER, CAST) in WHERE clauses that block index use.',
        'Ignoring query plans or never tuning them.',
        'Having too many open database connections without pooling or limits.',
        'Storing large blobs or unstructured data in relational tables instead of using a document store.',

    conclusion: `Optimizing database performance involves a combination of smart querying, efficient schema design, and choosing appropriate tools. Developers should regularly analyze query plans, apply indexing best practices, and avoid bloated or redundant data structures. Whether using PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or another system, performance tuning at the data layer has one of the biggest impacts on user-facing speed. With proactive monitoring and thoughtful design, your database can scale smoothly and support demanding applications.`,
