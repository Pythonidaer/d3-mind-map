    introduction: `React provides a component-driven model for building UI applications, but its reactivity and rendering model introduce unique performance challenges. As applications grow, developers must be deliberate about minimizing re-renders, avoiding unnecessary recalculations, and controlling how components respond to state and prop changes. This article explores React-specific optimization techniques like memoization, render control strategies, and updates in the React 19 compiler that enhance performance.`,

    conclusion: `React-specific optimizations are not just about avoiding re-renders—they’re about ensuring your application remains responsive, scalable, and efficient as complexity increases. By understanding how React evaluates component changes and when to re-render, developers can structure their applications to use memoization, context, and compiler features effectively. Tools like useMemo, useCallback, React.memo, and PureComponent form the foundation of performance tuning in modern React. However, over-optimization can be just as harmful as under-optimization. When used thoughtfully, these strategies provide major gains in speed and user satisfaction.`,
