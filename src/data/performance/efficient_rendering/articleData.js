    introduction: `Efficient frontend rendering is crucial for delivering smooth, responsive user experiences. As applications grow in complexity, poor rendering strategies can result in sluggish interfaces, janky scrolling, or excessive resource usage. This article explores techniques like list virtualization, lazy loading, and code splitting—each offering ways to balance interactivity, performance, and perceived speed. We also address overuse concerns and implementation-specific tradeoffs.`,

    codeExamples: [
      {
        title: 'React Virtualized List Example (react-window)',
        code: `import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

        entry.target.src = entry.target.dataset.src;

        code: `import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
  
  const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
  
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <LazyComponent />
  </Suspense>;`,

        title: 'Native Lazy Loading for Images',
        code: `<img src="hero.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Hero image" />`,

      {
        title: 'Dynamic Import of a JavaScript Module',
        code: `async function loadData() {
    const module = await import('./data');
    const data = module.getData();
    render(data);
  }`,
      },
    ],
  
    conclusion: `Efficient rendering is not a one-size-fits-all solution—it’s a toolkit of strategies that must be applied thoughtfully. List virtualization can drastically improve scroll performance, lazy loading ensures that non-critical resources don’t block the render path, and code splitting keeps bundles lean and fast. However, these techniques must be balanced with usability and maintainability. By profiling real usage patterns and testing under varied conditions, developers can adopt efficient rendering patterns that scale well while delivering an excellent user experience.`,
