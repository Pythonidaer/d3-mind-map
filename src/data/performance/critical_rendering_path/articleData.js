    introduction: `The Critical Rendering Path (CRP) describes the sequence of steps a browser takes to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visible pixels on the screen. Optimizing this path is essential for improving page load speed and perceived performance. This article explores each stage of the CRP, common bottlenecks, and specific frontend techniques to reduce delays and ensure fast, responsive rendering.`,

      title: 'Key Principles of the CRP',
      content: [
        'Rendering is sequential: each stage of the CRP must complete before the next begins.',
        'HTML and CSS are both blocking resources that affect how fast content appears.',
        'JavaScript can interrupt or delay parsing and rendering unless handled properly.',
        'Each stage (DOM, CSSOM, Render Tree, Layout, Paint) offers opportunities for optimization.',
      ],

      content: [
        'Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).',
        'Improved Time to Interactive (TTI), reducing bounce rates.',
        'Enhanced user experience, especially on slower networks or devices.',
        'Greater control over perceived load performance and progressive rendering.',

      title: 'Consequences of an Unoptimized CRP',
      content: [
        'Blocking resources delay visual feedback, leading to perceived slowness.',
        'Large or unscoped CSS and synchronous scripts stall DOM parsing.',
        'Reflows and repaints consume CPU cycles, hurting performance on low-powered devices.',
        'Flash of unstyled content (FOUC) and janky scrolling can result from poor paint management.',
      ],
    },
  
    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'CRP Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
      content: [
        'Using @import in CSS, which delays downloads and blocks rendering.',
        'Putting large scripts in the <head> without async/defer attributes.',
        'Manipulating the DOM before it’s fully built, triggering multiple reflows.',
        'Using complex visual effects (e.g., shadows and gradients) on frequently updated elements.',
      ],

    codeExamples: [
      {
        title: 'Defer or async to prevent render-blocking JS',
        code: `<script src="app.js" defer></script>
  <script src="tracker.js" async></script>`,

        title: 'Avoiding layout thrashing',
        code: `// Bad: layout thrashing
  const width = element.offsetWidth;
  element.style.width = width + 10 + 'px';
  
  // Better: batch reads and writes
  const width = element.offsetWidth;
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    element.style.width = width + 10 + 'px';
  });`,

        title: 'Using will-change for smooth transitions',
        code: `.tooltip {
    will-change: opacity, transform;
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
  }`,
      },
    ],
  
    conclusion: `Optimizing the Critical Rendering Path is one of the most powerful ways to improve frontend performance. By understanding how the browser processes content—from parsing HTML and CSS to painting elements on screen—developers can reduce blocking behavior, prioritize visible content, and streamline user interactions. When each stage of the CRP is thoughtfully optimized, websites become faster, smoother, and more resilient to varying device and network conditions.`,
