    introduction: `Frontend performance refers to how quickly and efficiently the user interface of a web application loads, renders, and becomes interactive. It directly impacts the user's perception of quality, usability, and reliability. This article explores key areas affecting frontend performance, including page load times, the impact of mobile-first browsing, critical rendering path awareness, and bottlenecks to avoid.`,

    conclusion: `Frontend performance is one of the most critical areas in web development, as it determines how users experience and judge a site’s quality. While much of the work involves understanding browser mechanics like the Critical Rendering Path, many optimizations involve thoughtful code structure—avoiding bloated HTML, minimizing render-blocking resources, and delivering content progressively. By reducing bottlenecks and streamlining rendering, developers can create fast, reliable, and engaging experiences across all devices.`,
