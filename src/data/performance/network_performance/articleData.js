    introduction: `Network performance optimization is essential for delivering fast, reliable web experiences. As applications grow richer, the overhead of transferring assets, API calls, and rendering initial content can become a bottleneck. By strategically leveraging caching, reducing unnecessary requests, utilizing service workers, and distributing assets via CDNs, developers can dramatically decrease latency and improve reliability—even under challenging network conditions. This article expands on each of these strategies, explores their benefits and pitfalls, and provides guidance for avoiding common mistakes.`,

        `Effective caching involves a combination of CDN caching, browser caching, and application-level caches. By placing static assets on a CDN, you reduce geographic latency. Browser caches, governed by HTTP headers, prevent repeated downloads of unchanged resources. Application caches—using service workers—offer fine-grained control over what and when to cache, ensuring assets remain available even offline.`

    conclusion: `Optimizing network performance is a multi-faceted endeavor that touches every layer of a web application. By adopting prudent caching strategies, minimizing requests, leveraging service workers, and distributing assets via CDNs, developers can create resilient, fast-loading experiences that delight users even under suboptimal network conditions. Thoughtful cache invalidation and infrastructure setup ensure content freshness, while SSR and offline capabilities round out a comprehensive performance strategy.`
