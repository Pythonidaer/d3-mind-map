    introduction: `JavaScript is essential to interactivity and functionality on the web, but it is also one of the most significant performance bottlenecks. Large scripts take longer to download, parse, and execute, delaying meaningful content and interactivity. This article explores techniques to reduce JavaScript bloat, delay unnecessary execution, and eliminate dead codeâ€”resulting in faster initial load times, better Time to Interactive (TTI), and improved runtime responsiveness.`,

    conclusion: `Minimizing JavaScript execution is one of the highest-leverage areas for improving web performance. It reduces page load time, speeds up interactivity, and keeps resource usage low on constrained devices. Developers should implement code splitting strategically, adopt lazy loading thoughtfully, and ensure tree-shaking works effectively by avoiding anti-patterns like wildcard imports. With regular profiling and modular architecture, JavaScript can remain powerful without becoming a liability.`,
