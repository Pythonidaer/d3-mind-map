  introduction: `Every Elementor site is built on top of a WordPress theme—even if you're unaware of it. Understanding which theme you're using, how to switch to a better one, and how Elementor interacts with themes is foundational to building flexible, high-performance sites. This article explains the role of themes in Elementor, how to check and change them, which themes are recommended, and how to optimize them for compatibility with the Elementor builder.`,

      'Use one **only if**:',
      '- You are modifying core PHP files of the theme.',
      '- You are inserting code snippets (e.g., enqueue scripts, add filters).',
      '- You need persistent changes that survive theme updates.',
      'If you’re only using Elementor (and not coding the theme itself), a child theme is **not necessary**.'

  conclusion: `Your Elementor experience is deeply influenced by your underlying WordPress theme—even if you never interact with it directly. Choosing a lightweight, compatible theme gives you a stable foundation for visual design and reduces layout bugs and frustrations. Themes like Hello Elementor and Astra are trusted choices for users who want either full control or helpful built-in layout options. By learning how to inspect, install, and configure themes, you gain more power over your build process and can unlock Elementor’s full visual editing potential.`,
