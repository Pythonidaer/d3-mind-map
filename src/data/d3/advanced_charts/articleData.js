    introduction: `Beyond basic charts, D3.js excels at creating complex, high-dimensional, and interactive visualizations. These advanced techniques leverage D3’s layout engines, geometry modules, force simulations, and interactivity layers to create data experiences that go far beyond bar and line charts. This section explores specialized capabilities such as maps, treemaps, force-directed graphs, radial hierarchies, and smooth animated transitions—alongside the structural decisions that ensure these complex builds remain performant and maintainable.`,

        `D3’s real strength shines in advanced scenarios: geospatial visualizations, clustered networks, radial trees, and interactive dashboards. These aren’t just “charts”—they’re full data applications that respond to user input and represent complex data structures with precision and flexibility.`,
        `To use these techniques effectively, you must understand not only D3’s APIs but how to structure your data for layout engines, how to manage performance in the DOM, and how to separate rendering from interaction logic.`,
      ],
    },
  
    maps: {
      title: 'Geographic Visualizations',
      content: [
        `D3’s \`d3-geo\` module enables rich geographic visualizations by projecting geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude) into 2D space. This unlocks the ability to render maps, overlay data on countries, and create geospatial interactions.`,
        `GeoJSON and TopoJSON data define the outlines of real-world features like countries, states, or neighborhoods. D3 can then apply map projections like Mercator or Albers to transform and render these shapes on screen.`,
      ],
    },
  
    geojson_topojson: {
      title: 'Working with GeoJSON and TopoJSON',
      content: [
        `GeoJSON is a common format for describing geographic features. D3 consumes this data using \`d3.geoPath()\`, which converts geographic coordinates into SVG path strings. TopoJSON is a compressed format that reuses shared borders for efficiency.`,
        `You load this data using \`d3.json()\`, parse it, and pass it into a path generator configured with a map projection. This allows you to create political maps, spatial overlays, or choropleths with ease.`,
      ],
    },
  
    projections: {
      title: 'Map Projections',
      content: [
        `D3 supports a wide range of geographic projections: \`geoMercator\`, \`geoAlbersUsa\`, \`geoOrthographic\`, and many others. These mathematical models convert spherical Earth coordinates into 2D screen positions.`,
        `Choosing the right projection depends on the region being displayed, desired distortion characteristics, and visual clarity. For example, Mercator is good for navigation but distorts poles, while Albers preserves area at the cost of shape.`,
      ],
    },
  
    treemaps: {
      title: 'Treemaps and Hierarchical Layouts',
      content: [
        `Treemaps visualize hierarchical data as nested rectangles sized by a quantitative value. They’re excellent for showing part-to-whole relationships with hierarchical depth—like folder sizes or budget allocations.`,
        `D3 computes treemaps using a two-step process: converting nested JSON into a hierarchy, then applying the \`d3.treemap()\` layout to calculate rectangle dimensions.`,
      ],
    },
  
    hierarchy_data: {
      title: 'Structuring Hierarchical Data',
      content: [
        `Start by using \`d3.hierarchy()\` to turn your nested data (e.g., categories with children) into a node tree. This step aggregates values and allows layout engines like \`d3.treemap()\` or \`d3.tree()\` to work properly.`,
        `You can then use node properties like \`x0, y0, x1, y1\` for rendering each child rectangle.`,
      ],
    },
  
    rect_generation: {
      title: 'Drawing Treemap Rectangles',
      content: [
        `After computing the layout, bind nodes to \`<rect>\` elements and use their calculated coordinates to set width, height, and position. You can apply color scales to encode category or depth and add labels with \`<text>\` inside each rectangle.`,
      ],
    },
  
    networks: {
      title: 'Force-Directed Network Diagrams',
      content: [
        `D3’s \`d3-force\` module allows you to simulate networks of nodes and links using physical forces. These diagrams are often used in social network analysis, entity relationships, or systems with complex interconnections.`,
        `Instead of fixed coordinates, node positions are calculated dynamically through a simulation loop.`,
      ],

    simulation_forces: {
      title: 'Configuring Force Simulations',
      content: [
        `Use \`d3.forceSimulation()\` to initialize the network, then add forces like:\n- \`forceManyBody()\`: repulsion\n- \`forceLink()\`: attraction between nodes\n- \`forceCenter()\`: keep the graph centered\n- \`forceCollide()\`: prevent overlap`,
        `Each tick of the simulation updates node coordinates, which are then applied to \`<circle>\` and \`<line>\` elements in your SVG.`,
      ],
    },
  
    drag_behavior: {
      title: 'Making Nodes Draggable',
      content: [
        `Use \`d3.drag()\` to enable user interaction. You define drag event listeners for \`start\`, \`drag\`, and \`end\` to update node positions manually. This lets users rearrange parts of the network and explore clusters in more detail.`,
      ],
    },
  
    radial_hierarchy: {
      title: 'Radial Trees and Cluster Layouts',
      content: [
        `D3’s \`d3.tree()\` and \`d3.cluster()\` layouts compute hierarchical node-link diagrams. These can be rendered in a vertical, horizontal, or radial (circular) format depending on how you map their output.`,
        `Radial trees are especially useful when you have symmetric or dense branching structures and want to conserve space while still showing depth.`,
      ],
    },
  
    polar_coords: {
      title: 'Polar Coordinate Transformation',
      content: [
        `To create radial trees, convert x/y values from Cartesian to polar coordinates using trigonometry: angle = x, radius = y. Then use:\n\`x = radius * cos(angle)\`\n\`y = radius * sin(angle)\``,
        `This creates a circular layout from the normal tree layout structure.`,

    },
  
    interactivity: {
      title: 'Transitions and Interactivity',
      content: [
        `Interactivity is a hallmark of D3 visualizations. From smooth transitions to dynamic tooltips, D3 enables you to bind behaviors directly to the data and DOM structure. This makes for compelling, exploratory graphics.`,
      ],
    },
  
    hover_events: {
      title: 'Mouse Events and Tooltips',
      content: [
        `Use \`.on('mouseover', ...)\`, \`.on('mouseout', ...)\`, or \`.on('click', ...)\` to bind events to DOM elements. You can highlight parts of a chart, show tooltips with more data, or filter other parts of the view based on interaction.`,
        `Tooltips can be implemented with HTML divs, SVG labels, or libraries like Tippy.js.`,
      ],
    },
  
    transitions: {
      title: 'Smooth Transitions',
      content: [
        `Use \`d3.transition()\` to animate changes in position, size, color, or any other visual attribute. This helps users perceive change over time, smooths state updates, and improves aesthetic appeal.`,
        `Transitions work with any DOM attribute or style and can be chained or sequenced using duration/delay settings.`,
      ],
    },
  
    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Anti-Patterns in Complex D3 Visualizations',
      content: [
        `Advanced D3 usage can introduce serious performance or maintenance issues if not handled carefully. Here are two of the most common mistakes you should avoid.`,
      ],
    },
  
    too_many_elements: {
      title: 'Overloading the DOM',
      content: [
        `Rendering thousands of individual SVG elements (circles, paths, etc.) can cause serious performance degradation. Consider using the Canvas API or WebGL for large-scale scatter plots or dense networks.`,
        `D3 can drive Canvas rendering too — you don’t have to stick to SVG.`,
      ],
    },
  
    complex_code: {
      title: 'Overly Tangled Code',
      content: [
        `Mixing layout logic, rendering code, and interactivity in one large block makes your visualizations hard to maintain or reuse. Separate concerns: use functions for rendering, data processing, and behavior logic.`,
        `Also consider isolating transitions and events in separate files when building complex dashboards or embedded graphics.`,
      ],
    },
  
    conclusion: `D3’s advanced capabilities empower developers to go far beyond conventional data viz. From maps to force-directed networks, radial trees to animated transitions, D3 offers unmatched expressiveness—but only if you wield it wisely. Structure your code carefully, understand the mathematical models behind layouts, and be deliberate about performance. These techniques make D3 a true powerhouse for storytelling with data.`,
