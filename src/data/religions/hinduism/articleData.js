  introduction: `
Hinduism is one of the world's oldest and most diverse religious traditions, originating in the Indian subcontinent. Rather than a single doctrine, it encompasses a wide range of beliefs, practices, texts, and philosophical schools. Core themes include the pursuit of dharma (righteous duty), the law of karma (cause and effect), and the quest for moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth).
