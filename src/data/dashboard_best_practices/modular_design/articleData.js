    introduction: `Modular design is a cornerstone of scalable, maintainable, and reusable frontend systems. It focuses on breaking down applications into smaller, self-contained parts that can be independently developed, tested, reused, and replaced. In the context of frontend engineering—especially with component-based frameworks like React—modular design allows for clean separation of logic and presentation, facilitates team collaboration, and makes projects easier to understand and extend over time.`,
  
    keyPrinciples: {
      title: 'Core Principles of Modular Design',
      content: [
        'Each module or component should have a single responsibility.',
        'Modules must be loosely coupled, meaning one module’s logic shouldn’t deeply depend on another.',
        'The design should encourage reusability—components or utilities should be written generically and reused in different parts of the app.',
        'Isolation and encapsulation should prevent side effects or hidden dependencies.',
        'Consistent naming conventions, directory structures, and documentation help enforce modular thinking across teams.'
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_componentization: {
      title: 'Component-Based Architecture',
      content: [
        'The most common manifestation of modular design in frontend development is the use of components. In React, Vue, and similar libraries, UI components encapsulate markup, logic, and style within isolated building blocks. For example, a reusable <Tooltip /> or <UploadButton /> component can appear across multiple views and contexts, adapting to props and styles passed into it.',
        'These components should remain self-contained: logic should live within or beside the component if simple, or be abstracted out if shared. Styles can be co-located via CSS Modules, Tailwind classes, or component-scoped styles like Emotion.',
        'The key is composability—components should be flexible enough to nest within one another, receive children, or allow content slots without losing encapsulation.'
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_atomic_design: {
      title: 'Atomic Design and Reusability',
      content: [
        'Atomic Design is a methodology for thinking about UI systems hierarchically, from smallest to largest: Atoms (e.g., buttons), Molecules (e.g., input + label), Organisms (e.g., forms), Templates (layouts), and Pages (views).',
        'This approach encourages granular component creation early in a project, which avoids monolith components that are hard to split later. It also creates a natural path for evolving design systems and component libraries.',
        'Reusable atoms and molecules, once documented and standardized, form the basis of scalable user interfaces that maintain visual and functional consistency.'
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_separation_of_concerns: {
      title: 'Separation of Concerns',
      content: [
        'Modular design emphasizes the clear separation of logic, presentation, and state. Presentational components (sometimes called dumb components) focus solely on how things look. They receive props and emit events. In contrast, container components (smart components) manage state, handle data fetching, and pass data down.',
        'Hooks and services further modularize this structure by removing business logic from UI code entirely. For instance, a `useJobTrends()` hook can encapsulate API calls, transformations, and error handling for any dashboard module that needs it.',
        'By avoiding duplication and centralizing logic in utilities or shared modules, this pattern also supports testing and maintenance.'
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_scalability: {
      title: 'Scalability and Maintainability',
      content: [
        'As frontend projects grow from a few screens to complex systems, modular design supports clean refactoring and onboarding. A consistent directory structure (e.g., grouping by feature or domain) makes it easy to find and update code.',
        'Decoupled components reduce the risk of a single change causing unexpected side effects elsewhere. Dependency injection or context providers allow shared resources (e.g., themes, analytics, translations) to be injected modularly.',
        'When multiple teams are involved, modularity enables parallel development—each feature can live in its own folder with localized logic, tests, and styles.'
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_extensibility: {
      title: 'Extensibility and Plugin Architecture',
      content: [
        'Well-designed modules can be reused across products, especially in the form of shared component libraries. For example, a company-wide UI library might export <Button />, <FormField />, <Dialog />, and so on.',
        'Plugin architecture allows for entire modules—such as analytics dashboards, admin panels, or job parsing logic—to be loaded dynamically or registered into the app at runtime. This allows the core system to remain lean, while enabling extendability via well-defined contracts.',
        'Decoupling modules like this also facilitates A/B testing, feature toggles, and on-demand loading (e.g., micro-frontends or monorepos).'
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_cons: {
      title: 'Cons and Tradeoffs of Modular Design',
      content: [
        'Despite its strengths, modular design can become over-engineered. Creating abstractions too early may lead to complexity that offers little immediate value.',
        'Without proper design systems or linting conventions, modular systems can become fragmented—resulting in different teams building near-identical components that behave or look slightly different.',
        'A highly modular codebase also has a steeper learning curve. New developers may struggle to trace logic through layers of indirection, especially when modules are deeply nested or follow inconsistent patterns.'
      ]
    },
  
    codeExamples: [
      {
        title: 'Presentational vs Container Component',
        code: `
  // Presentational
  const SkillCard = ({ name, frequency }) => (
    <div className="skill-card">
      <h4>{name}</h4>
      <p>{frequency} mentions</p>
    </div>
  );
  
  // Container
  const TrendingSkills = () => {
    const { data } = useTrendingSkills();
    return (
      <div>
        {data.map(skill => (
          <SkillCard key={skill.id} {...skill} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }
        `.trim()
      },
      {
        title: 'Shared Hook for Data Fetching',
        code: `
  import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
  
  export function useJobTrends(title) {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() => {
      fetch(\`/api/trends?title=\${title}\`)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(setData);
    }, [title]);
    return { data };
  }
        `.trim()
      }
    ],
  
    conclusion: `Modular design isn't just a pattern—it's a mindset. It reshapes how you approach layout, structure, reusability, and collaboration across frontend projects. From atomic components to plugin-style systems, modularity empowers you to build for the long term. But like all powerful paradigms, it comes with tradeoffs that require discipline, documentation, and architectural foresight. When done right, modular design produces code that’s testable, adaptable, scalable, and truly developer-friendly.`
