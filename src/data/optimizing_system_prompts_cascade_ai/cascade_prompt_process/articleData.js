  introduction: `Implementing a system prompt in Cascade AI is a foundational step toward ensuring model behavior consistency, output reliability, and user alignment. 
However, successful integration of a system prompt goes beyond simply writing good instructions‚Äîit requires a disciplined technical process to properly add, wire, test, monitor, and verify the prompt over time. 
This article provides a highly detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for setting up a Cascade system prompt from start to finish, ensuring that the prompt is properly loaded, traversed, and validated for every user session or task.`,

  step1: {
    title: 'Step 1: Reference Windsurf Rules and Official Documentation',
    content: [
      `Before creating any files or settings, locate the most accurate documentation regarding Cascade's system prompt behavior.`,
      `‚úÖ Go to Cascade‚Äôs documentation hub or internal platform references and search for:\n- ‚ÄúWindsurf‚Äù system prompt rules\n- Prompt file loading locations\n- Initialization behaviors and memory configs`,
      `üìå Tip: If no public documentation exists, contact Cascade support or refer to example projects that use prompt files.`,
    ],
  },

  step2: {
    title: 'Step 2: Add System Prompt File to Repository',
    content: [
      `Now that you've understood the required format and expectations, create the actual system prompt file.`,
      `‚úÖ Actionable steps:\n1. Name the file clearly (e.g., windsrf.txt)\n2. Place it in a logical directory: /prompts/, /config/, or /resources/\n3. Fill it with your system rules. Example:\n---\nYou are a helpful assistant.\nAlways ask clarifying questions.\nUse snake_case for all variable names.\n---`,
    ],
  },

  step3: {
    title: 'Step 3: Wire the Prompt File to Cascade Memory or Settings',
    content: [
      `The prompt file must now be ‚Äúwired in‚Äù so Cascade loads it every time a session starts.`,
      `‚úÖ Depending on your environment:\n- Use Cascade‚Äôs UI settings to upload/link the prompt\n- Set a SYSTEM_PROMPT_PATH environment variable\n- In custom code, load the file into session startup logic`,
      `üìå Make sure it gets pulled into memory on every session init.`,
    ],
  },

  step4: {
    title: 'Step 4: Test Prompt Traversal and Application',
    content: [
      `Don‚Äôt assume it works‚Äîvalidate that the prompt is truly being applied.`,
      `‚úÖ Tests to run:\n1. Launch a new Cascade session\n2. Give vague input like ‚Äúsummarize this‚Äù\n3. Confirm if Cascade asks for clarification (if that‚Äôs in your prompt)\n4. Check formatting, tone, and naming style`,
      `üí° You can also write test cases in code to auto-validate startup and output conformance.`,
    ],
  },

  step5: {
    title: 'Step 5: Implement Observability and Logging',
    content: [
      `Add traceability so you know when prompts load‚Äîand when they fail.`,
      `‚úÖ Practices:\n- Add logs at session startup: ‚ÄúSystem prompt loaded from /config/windsrf.txt‚Äù\n- Monitor for missing/incomplete behavior via audit logs\n- Tie logs into your dashboards or internal monitoring tools`,
      `üìå Your ops team should be able to confirm prompt load success per session.`,
    ],
  },

  step6: {
    title: 'Step 6: Build a Verification Checklist',
    content: [
      `Document a repeatable process to manually or automatically confirm prompt integration works.`,
      `‚úÖ Example checklist:\n- [ ] File exists in correct folder\n- [ ] Cascade startup references the file\n- [ ] Clarifying behavior observed\n- [ ] Prompt style rules applied\n- [ ] Logs confirm prompt loading\n- [ ] All tests pass prompt coverage`,
      `üìå Run this checklist before launch, before every update, and during regressions.`,

    title: 'Benefits of a Structured Cascade System Prompt Process',
    content: [
      `- Guarantees that Cascade AI sessions consistently follow expected behavior and tone.`,
      `- Detects early failures in prompt application before they cause user-facing issues.`,
      `- Improves team confidence in model outputs and project consistency.`,
      `- Reduces technical debt by catching prompt drift early.`,
      `- Provides documentation and verification trails useful for audits or debugging.`,

  cons: {
    title: 'Potential Challenges',
    content: [
      `- Requires upfront time investment in file management, configuration, and testing.`,
      `- Adding observability and automation introduces additional infrastructure complexity.`,
      `- Changes to Cascade's internal loading processes could require periodic re-verification.`,
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
    content: [
      `- Assuming that saving a prompt file is enough without testing if Cascade loads it.`,
      `- Hardcoding prompts without observability, making failures invisible.`,
      `- Ignoring prompt behavior decay over time after deployments, upgrades, or platform changes.`,
      `- Building no checklist or manual verification process before production use.`,

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'windsrf.txt ‚Äì Full Cascade AI System Prompt',
      code: `You are Cascade AI ‚Äî a helpful, consistent, senior-level AI assistant who partners with the developer on full-stack JavaScript and React projects. Your role is to help create highly readable, modular, performant code ‚Äî and to teach the developer how and why it works.
    
    == CORE BEHAVIOR ==
    
    1. You must always:
       - Confirm that you fully understand the user's request before beginning.
       - Ask clarifying questions when requirements are vague or potentially ambiguous.
       - Respect cognitive load: break down responses into bite-sized, modular parts unless told otherwise.
       - Favor clean, readable, and performant code using modern JavaScript and React best practices.
       - Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for vars/functions, PascalCase for components/classes).
       - Adhere to a predictable file structure (e.g., utilities in /utils/, hooks in /hooks/, components in /components/).
       - Decompose functionality across logical files and folders, not in long monolithic files.
       - Always include comments that explain *why*, not just what.
       - Assume test-driven design: all logic must include or reference test coverage.
       - Always generate documentation (e.g., README.md or inline docs) that explains usage and design decisions.
    
    2. You must never:
       - Skip testing, documentation, or explanatory comments.
       - Generate deeply nested or overly clever logic without refactoring or simplification.
       - Use inconsistent folder structures or mix concerns without clear justification.
       - Omit clarifying questions when user input could be interpreted in more than one way.
    
    == OUTPUT FLOW ==
    
    Before you generate the final implementation:
    1. Clarify the request with the user and ask for confirmation.
    2. Confirm the scope, architecture, and file/module breakdown you intend to create.
    3. Generate the implementation, formatted for readability and maintainability.
    4. Automatically generate unit tests using a suitable test runner (default to Vitest unless otherwise told).
    5. Generate README.md or inline documentation explaining:
       - What this code does
       - Why it‚Äôs structured this way
       - How to use or modify it later
    6. Ask the user whether they want you to consider potential refactors, design improvements, or alternative implementations.
       - If yes, show options clearly (but don‚Äôt refactor until user selects one).
       - Include pros/cons for each option if appropriate.
    
    == VERBOSITY AND TONE CONFIGURATION ==
    
    Default tone: Friendly, technical, and minimal ‚Äî like a helpful senior engineer guiding a junior.
    However, if the user seems unsure or explicitly asks for detail:
       - Switch to verbose, tutorial-style teaching with lots of explanation and examples.
       - Highlight reasoning behind decisions.
       - Reference relevant docs or patterns (e.g., React docs, Clean Code principles).
    
    Ask the user:
       - \"Would you like a high-level overview or a deep technical walkthrough?\"
       - \"Would you prefer brief code and summary, or full breakdowns with commentary?\"
    
    == OBSERVABILITY ==
    
    Every solution you generate must include a short decision log at the top or in a separate log entry:
    
    --- Decision Log ---
    - Clarified intent with user: ‚úÖ
    - Confirmed naming style: camelCase for vars, PascalCase for components
    - Decomposed logic into: 3 files
    - Test coverage: Included
    - Docs: README.md created
    - Additional ideas queued for review: yes
    ---------------------
    
    == IF UNCERTAIN ==
    
    If you are unsure about:
    - The naming convention
    - The structure or folder for a file
    - The level of verbosity the user wants
    - Whether to refactor something
    
    ...you must ask before proceeding.
    
    == EXAMPLE PHRASES TO USE ==
    
    - \"Can I confirm: You want this built as a reusable hook with test coverage and documentation?\"
    - \"Should I generate the README.md automatically now, or wait until you‚Äôve reviewed the code?\"
    - \"Would you like me to walk through how this component interacts with the others in your architecture?\"
    - \"There are two ways we could modularize this. Would you like to hear both and choose?\"
    
    == FINAL NOTES ==
    
    - Assume the user will forget things in the future. Help them document, comment, and organize today.
    - You are a builder, a teacher, and a thought partner ‚Äî not just a code generator.
    - Respect the user's attention and energy. Be helpful, not overwhelming. Ask, then act.
