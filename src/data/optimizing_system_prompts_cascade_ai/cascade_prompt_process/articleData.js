  introduction: `Implementing a system prompt in Cascade AI is a foundational step toward ensuring model behavior consistency, output reliability, and user alignment. 
  However, successful integration of a system prompt goes beyond simply writing good instructions—it requires a disciplined technical process to properly add, wire, test, monitor, and verify the prompt over time. 
  This article provides a highly detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for setting up a Cascade system prompt from start to finish, ensuring that the prompt is properly loaded, traversed, and validated for every user session or task.`,

      title: 'Reference Windsurf Rules and Official Documentation',
      content: [
        `Before creating any files or settings, it's critical to first understand the official guidelines Cascade AI expects for system prompts.`,
        `Begin by locating and thoroughly reading any available documentation or platform articles about the "windsurf" prompt format, or any system prompt conventions used by Cascade. 
  Look for keywords like "windsurf rules," "system prompt best practices," or "startup memory configuration" inside the Cascade documentation center, platform settings, release notes, or community forums.`,
        `If no official guide exists, look for internal examples, reference system prompts from official projects, or contact Cascade support to verify best practices.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Add System Prompt File to Repository',
      content: [
        `Once you understand the basic structure, create your system prompt file locally.`,
        `Recommended steps:
          **Naming**: Follow any naming conventions (e.g., windsrf.txt, system_prompt.md).
          **Folder Location**: Save it in a logically organized location in your project, such as a /prompts/, /config/, or /resources/ directory.
          **Contents**: The file should include all instructions you want Cascade AI to load at the beginning of sessions (style rules, clarification behaviors, modularity requests, tone guidance, etc.).`,
        `Example structure inside windsrf.txt:
  ---
  You are a structured, helpful assistant.
  You always ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear.
  All outputs must be modular and easy to read.
  You must use snake_case for all function names.
  ---

      title: 'Wire Prompt File to Cascade Memory or Settings',
      content: [
        `Creating the file is not enough—it must be correctly referenced in Cascade AI’s configuration.`,
        `Recommended wiring process:
          **Check Settings Panel**: See if Cascade has an interface where you can upload or link your system prompt file.
          **Environment Variables**: Some platforms allow you to set a SYSTEM_PROMPT_PATH or similar variable to point to your custom prompt file.
          **Session Initialization Code**: If you are programmatically starting sessions, include logic that loads your prompt file at session boot-up.`,
        `Make sure that when a user session begins, Cascade AI:
          Reads the system prompt file contents
          Loads the prompt into memory
          Applies the behavior for all subsequent user interactions`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Test Prompt Traversal and Application',
      content: [
        `After wiring, you must confirm that Cascade actually loads and honors the prompt every time.`,
        `Recommended tests:
          **Smoke Test**: Start a new session and deliberately give vague or ambiguous input. Confirm that Cascade AI asks clarifying questions as the prompt instructed.
          **Behavioral Checks**: Test if naming conventions, output formatting, tone, and modularity are automatically respected.
          **Edge Case Testing**: Provide contradictory or borderline inputs to ensure the system falls back to clarifying or modular behavior rather than default behaviors.`,
        `Optional: Write lightweight automated unit tests to programmatically start a session and verify expected system properties or welcome messages triggered by the prompt.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Implement Observability and Logging',
      content: [
        `Building observability ensures you can monitor whether prompts continue functioning correctly across deployments or upgrades.`,
        `Recommended observability practices:
          **Prompt Load Logs**: Add explicit logging that confirms when the system prompt was loaded successfully during session startup. 
          Example log: "[INFO] System prompt loaded successfully from /config/windsrf.txt."
          **Session Behavior Logs**: Log anomalies when model outputs appear inconsistent with system prompt expectations.
          **Monitoring Dashboards**: If working in production, tie prompt load events into broader application monitoring dashboards.`,
        `Goal: Ensure you always know if prompt loading fails silently, if prompt behaviors degrade, or if configuration drift occurs.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Build a Verification Checklist',
      content: [
        `Before going live—or after every update—you should verify system prompt functionality using a manual or automated checklist.`,
        `Recommended checklist items:
          Confirm system prompt file exists and is correctly named
          Confirm system prompt file is linked to Cascade AI initialization
          Start a session and validate clarifying question behavior
          Validate modular output formatting
          Validate consistency in naming conventions and style
          Review observability logs for successful prompt loading
          Confirm fallback behaviors if ambiguous input is given`,
        `Using this checklist ensures that your Cascade system prompt remains healthy, predictable, and effective, even as projects grow and evolve.`,

      `Assuming that saving a prompt file is enough without testing if Cascade loads it.`,
      `Hardcoding prompts without observability, making failures invisible.`,
      `Ignoring prompt behavior decay over time after deployments, upgrades, or platform changes.`,
      `Building no checklist or manual verification process before production use.`,

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Typical Startup Process Pseudocode',
      code: `// Pseudocode for session startup
  function initializeCascadeSession() {
    const systemPrompt = loadFile('/config/windsrf.txt');
    startCascadeSession({ systemPrompt });
    log('[INFO] System prompt loaded successfully.');
  }`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Example Log Statement on Successful Load',
      code: `// Example Log
  [INFO] Cascade session started.
  [INFO] System prompt loaded from /prompts/windsrf.txt.`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Checklist Item Example',
      code: `// Simple checklist snippet
  [x] System prompt file found
  [x] Session startup loads system prompt
  [x] Clarifying questions behavior verified
  [x] Observability logs captured prompt load`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `A well-designed system prompt is powerful—but only if it is properly implemented, tested, observed, and continuously verified. 
  Treat your Cascade AI system prompt not as a one-time configuration, but as a living, critical piece of your infrastructure, requiring engineering discipline and lifecycle management. 
  By following this highly structured process—from reference discovery to file creation, wiring, testing, logging, and verification—you dramatically increase the reliability, alignment, and trustworthiness of every AI interaction in your system.
  The best AI systems are not simply written—they are rigorously built, validated, and maintained, starting with the invisible foundation: the system prompt.`,
