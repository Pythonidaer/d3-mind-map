  introduction: `Achieving consistent naming in AI-generated content, particularly code, is a crucial but often overlooked aspect of prompt engineering. Inconsistent naming can drastically reduce code readability, increase cognitive load for users, and introduce maintenance challenges. Cascade AI, like other LLMs, benefits significantly from prompts that provide strong guidance on naming conventions. This article provides an in-depth exploration of strategies to ensure that your prompts consistently generate properly named variables, functions, classes, and other elements, making your outputs cleaner, more predictable, and more professional.`,

  principle1: {
    title: 'Explicit Instructions',
    content: [
      `The first and most fundamental principle is to give the model *explicit* instructions regarding naming conventions. General prompts like "write code" are not enough. If you want your code entities to follow snake_case, CamelCase, or PascalCase styles, you must state it clearly in your system prompt.`,
      `For example, saying "Use snake_case for all variable and function names, and PascalCase for class names" leaves no ambiguity for the model. If you want certain file types or database fields to follow specific casing or formatting rules, include those too. Ambiguity is the enemy of consistency.`,
      `When appropriate, differentiate by entity type: tell the model exactly which conventions apply to variables, functions, classes, constants, and so on.`,
    ],
  },

  principle2: {
    title: 'Providing Examples',
    content: [
      `Few-shot prompting is a highly effective way to solidify naming expectations. By giving 2–3 examples of properly named entities in your desired style, you offer concrete demonstrations of what success looks like.`,
      `For instance, including examples like "get_user_profile(), fetch_data()" shows what good snake_case functions look like, while showing "UserProfile, OrderManager" shows good PascalCase class names.`,
      `While positive examples are most important, you can optionally include bad examples too — as long as you clearly mark them as "Incorrect Example." This contrast can reinforce the correct pattern even more strongly.`,
    ],
  },

  principle3: {
    title: 'Format Specifications',
    content: [
      `Beyond just casing style, prompts should specify any additional formatting rules like required prefixes, suffixes, or delimiters.`,
      `For example, you might say "All configuration variables must start with config_" or "Separate words in names using underscores." If certain entity types require a common suffix like _service, _controller, or _repository, mention it clearly.`,
      `Specifying delimiters is also crucial. Should words be separated by underscores, hyphens, or nothing? Defining this detail helps ensure that output remains fully aligned with the intended style guidelines, particularly across multiple files or modules.`,
    ],
  },

  principle4: {
    title: 'Style Guide References',
    content: [
      `Sometimes the best way to guide naming is to simply reference an established style guide. For Python projects, referencing "PEP 8" immediately signals a rich, well-documented naming convention (like snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes, and so on).`,
      `If you are working in JavaScript, you might reference the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which emphasizes camelCase for variables and functions and PascalCase for React components.`,
      `Rather than reinventing standards every time, leveraging the authority of formal style guides strengthens your prompts and aligns model outputs with industry expectations.`,
    ],
  },

  principle5: {
    title: 'Consistent Terminology',
    content: [
      `The way you *talk* about entities inside your prompt affects the way the model *writes* them.`,
      `If you want snake_case naming, don't refer to "User ID" in your instructions — refer to it as "user_id." If you're expecting a variable like config_max_connections, mention it using that exact format.`,
      `Models mirror the language they are fed. Internal consistency in the prompt reduces model confusion and prevents drift from the intended style.`,
    ],
  },

  principle6: {
    title: 'Iterative Refinement',
    content: [
      `Even with well-constructed prompts, you may find that initial outputs contain inconsistencies.`,
      `This is where iterative refinement comes in: review the AI’s output critically and revise your prompts by tightening instructions, adding new examples, or reinforcing structure if needed.`,
      `For instance, if Cascade AI inconsistently capitalizes function names, your next prompt might explicitly say, "Ensure that **every** function name uses **only** lowercase letters and underscores." Prompt engineering is as much about observing and adjusting as it is about instructing.`,
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits of Consistent Naming Strategies',
    content: [
      `Improves code readability and reduces cognitive load for users reviewing or maintaining code.`,
      `Enhances predictability across multiple generated files or outputs.`,
      `Supports easier debugging and faster onboarding for teams.`,
      `Aligns AI outputs with professional industry standards.`,
      `Reduces the need for post-generation refactoring, saving significant time.`,
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Potential Challenges',
    content: [
      `Requires additional upfront planning to define naming conventions properly.`,
      `Overly strict naming guidelines may limit model flexibility if not balanced correctly.`,
      `Minor inconsistencies may still occur and require iterative refinement.`,
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
    content: [
      `Leaving naming conventions vague or assuming the model will "guess" correctly.`,
      `Providing contradictory examples or mixing naming styles within the prompt.`,
      `Using informal, conversational entity references inside the prompt ("User ID" vs. "user_id").`,
      `Neglecting to review and refine prompts if outputs show inconsistent naming.`,
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Explicitly Stating Naming Conventions',
      code: `// Good Prompt
"Use snake_case for all variables and functions. Use PascalCase for class names."

// Bad Prompt
"Write a program and name everything properly." // Too vague!`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Providing Positive Naming Examples',
      code: `// Good Prompt
"Here are examples of function names: get_user_profile(), fetch_order_data(). Here are examples of class names: UserProfile, OrderManager."

// Optional (with caution)
"Incorrect example: GetUserProfile() (wrong uses CamelCase instead of snake_case)."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Specifying Prefixes and Suffixes',
      code: `// Good Prompt
"All configuration variables should be prefixed with 'config_'. Example: config_max_connections, config_timeout_seconds."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Refining Based on Feedback',
      code: `// If initial output shows inconsistent casing:
"Ensure that **every** variable, function, and parameter strictly follows snake_case, without exceptions."`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Consistent naming is more than a stylistic preference—it is a fundamental pillar of clean, maintainable, professional-quality output. Instructing Cascade AI to generate properly named entities requires careful attention to how prompts are crafted, including explicit naming instructions, relevant examples, clear formatting rules, style guide references, and consistent internal language. 
By thoughtfully designing prompts and being willing to iteratively refine based on output, users can dramatically improve the quality, reliability, and professionalism of their AI-generated work. Treat naming not as an afterthought, but as a core architectural element of prompt design for maximum success.`,
