  introduction: `Modular code generation is essential for producing maintainable, scalable, and understandable software. When prompting Cascade AI to generate code, guiding the model to follow modular design principles leads to outputs that are easier to test, reuse, debug, and extend. Rather than asking the model to write large, monolithic blocks of code, modular prompting involves encouraging clear separation of concerns, use of interfaces, reusable patterns, and thoughtful architecture. This article covers the strategies needed to reliably generate modular code using prompt engineering techniques.`,

  principle1: {
    title: 'Explicit Modularity',
    content: [
      `The first step to modular generation is to be direct in your expectations. Simply asking the model to "write code" is insufficient. Your prompt should explicitly say: "Write modular code with reusable functions" or "Organize this into components that each handle a single task."`,
      `It helps to emphasize separation of concerns: instruct the model to isolate responsibilities into distinct modules or layers. Reinforcing modular thinking from the outset influences every design decision the model makes.`,
    ],
  },

  principle2: {
    title: 'Function/Class Decomposition',
    content: [
      `A hallmark of modularity is decomposition — breaking functionality down into small, manageable units. Cascade AI responds well to requests like: "Break this logic into multiple functions, each with a single responsibility," or "Decompose this into individual classes for input handling, processing, and output."`,
      `This granular organization improves clarity, facilitates debugging, and makes the code easier to test and extend. Each function or class should ideally follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).`,
    ],
  },

  principle3: {
    title: 'Modules and Packages',
    content: [
      `For larger systems, modularity extends beyond functions and classes — the model should be prompted to group related code into logical modules or packages.`,
      `You can say: "Organize this into separate modules for configuration, routing, and business logic," or "Separate UI components into a distinct package." This reinforces maintainability and prevents tight coupling between unrelated components.`,
    ],
  },

  principle4: {
    title: 'Design Patterns',
    content: [
      `Incorporating established design patterns helps the model generate predictable, scalable code. Patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Observer are not just theoretical—they provide reusable templates for solving common design problems.`,
      `Instructing the model to use a specific pattern—for example, "Use the Factory pattern to handle object creation"—produces cleaner, more robust architecture.`,
    ],
  },

  principle5: {
    title: 'Interface Specifications',
    content: [
      `Interfaces formalize how components interact. Prompt the model to either use predefined interfaces or define contracts for components to communicate.`,
      `For example, "Create an interface for data providers so that any class providing data must implement getData()" encourages clean separation between implementation and usage.`,
      `Emphasize *loose coupling* through interfaces—this minimizes ripple effects when changing internal implementations.`,
    ],
  },

  principle6: {
    title: 'Dependency Injection',
    content: [
      `To avoid hardcoded dependencies that entangle modules, prompt the use of dependency injection. This principle promotes testability and reusability.`,
      `A prompt like "Pass dependencies into the constructor instead of importing them directly" guides the model toward building swappable, composable components.`,
      `Dependency injection decouples logic from infrastructure and is especially helpful in services, plugins, or API clients.`,
    ],
  },

  principle7: {
    title: 'Code Examples',
    content: [
      `Demonstrating modular architecture through code is a powerful way to guide the model. Include examples that show how to break code into modules, how interfaces define behavior, or how a controller separates from the model.`,
      `Examples don’t need to be long—even 3–5 lines per module or function can set a strong template for Cascade AI to follow.`,
    ],
  },

  principle8: {
    title: 'Chain of Thought Planning',
    content: [
      `You can get more structured, thoughtful code by asking the model to plan before generating.`,
      `For example: "First, outline the modules needed for this project. Then, define the responsibilities of each. Finally, generate the code." This decomposes the design process itself and mirrors how a software engineer would plan their architecture.`,
      `This improves cohesion and prevents inconsistencies across components or layers.`,
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits of Modular Code Generation',
    content: [
      `Improves readability and maintainability of the generated code.`,
      `Makes testing, debugging, and future feature development easier.`,
      `Reduces code duplication by isolating reusable logic.`,
      `Supports team collaboration by separating components clearly.`,
      `Promotes architectural best practices that scale with project complexity.`,
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Potential Challenges',
    content: [
      `More verbose prompts are often required to enforce modular structure.`,
      `Without clear guidance, models may still default to monolithic patterns.`,
      `Overengineering modularity for simple tasks can lead to unnecessary complexity.`,
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
    content: [
      `Instructing AI to "write a script" without clarifying expectations of modularity.`,
      `Encouraging tightly coupled designs by hardcoding dependencies.`,
      `Ignoring interface boundaries, leading to scattered logic.`,
      `Asking for a "working solution" without considering long-term maintainability.`,
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Explicit Modularity Prompt',
      code: `// Good prompt
"Create modular code where each function has a single responsibility. Separate input parsing, validation, processing, and output into distinct components."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Using Factory Pattern',
      code: `// Example: Factory pattern for object creation
class NotificationFactory {
  static create(type) {
    if (type === 'email') return new EmailNotification();
    if (type === 'sms') return new SMSNotification();
  }
}`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Dependency Injection Prompt',
      code: `// Good prompt
"Inject dependencies like database clients into the constructor of the service class instead of importing them globally."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Planning Before Generating Code',
      code: `// Chain-of-thought prompt
"First outline the architecture: identify modules and their roles. Then generate the code for each."`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Modular code generation is not just a nice-to-have—it’s a foundational practice for building reliable, testable, and scalable software. When working with Cascade AI, prompt clarity is paramount. You must explicitly request modular structure, guide decomposition into functions and classes, encourage interface boundaries, and suggest reusable design patterns. The use of dependency injection and chain-of-thought prompting further elevate the quality and structure of generated code.
With the right approach, Cascade AI can move from code generation to architectural assistance—writing components that integrate cleanly, evolve safely, and support future development with minimal friction.`,
