  introduction: `Tailoring prompts specifically for Cascade AI presents unique challenges—and opportunities. Without an exhaustive public manual for platform-specific behaviors, users must rely on a combination of general prompt engineering principles, careful experimentation, and adaptive refinement. Effective tailoring involves applying known best practices while actively studying how Cascade AI responds, thereby building a custom knowledge base for achieving the best possible outputs. This article outlines practical strategies for adapting and perfecting your system and task prompts when working within Cascade AI.`,

  principle1: {
    title: 'Apply General Principles',
    content: [
      `Even in the absence of Cascade-specific documentation, you can apply foundational prompt engineering practices. This includes using clear, direct instructions, providing sufficient context, structuring inputs and outputs, and incorporating few-shot examples to guide model behavior.`,
      `Using section markers like "### Instructions" and "### Example" helps separate concerns and ensures the model processes the request logically. In general, structure and specificity remain your strongest allies when tailoring prompts.`,
    ],
  },

  principle2: {
    title: 'Test Prompt Variations',
    content: [
      `Different models respond to subtle differences in phrasing, format, and framing. Rather than assuming a single style works universally, create multiple variations of a prompt and evaluate their outputs.`,
      `Examples include changing tone ("You are an expert developer..." vs. "You are a helpful assistant..."), switching from imperative ("Do this") to advisory ("It would be better to..."), or varying structure (structured input vs. freeform).`,
      `Over time, you will uncover which types of prompts yield the clearest, most accurate results with Cascade AI.`,
    ],
  },

  principle3: {
    title: 'Monitor Model Behavior',
    content: [
      `Prompt tailoring is a feedback-driven process. It's not enough to review outputs casually—you must actively monitor trends.`,
      `Track aspects like:\n- How consistent are outputs across different prompts?\n- Are there common failure modes (e.g., hallucinations, omissions)?\n- Does the model handle ambiguity gracefully or poorly?`,
      `By systematically studying model behavior, you can fine-tune prompts to anticipate weaknesses and reinforce strengths.`,
    ],
  },

  principle4: {
    title: 'Explore Platform Resources',
    content: [
      `While Cascade AI may not yet have full public-facing prompt documentation, it’s wise to search for any available platform resources.`,
      `Check areas such as:\n- Official documentation or release notes\n- Hidden configuration options or beta features\n- Community discussion forums or support channels`,
      `Occasionally, specific tips, capabilities (such as temperature tuning), or naming conventions (like "windsurf") may surface that influence how prompts should be constructed.`,
    ],
  },

  principle5: {
    title: 'Adapt to Model Type',
    content: [
      `Not all AI models behave identically. Some favor generative, creative outputs, while others are built for careful reasoning and stepwise logic.`,
      `If Cascade AI is based on a reasoning model, it benefits from goal-driven prompts ("Step-by-step breakdowns"). If it leans generative, it responds better to structural constraints, examples, and narrow focus prompts.`,
      `Understanding the model's nature allows you to frame requests in ways that maximize its core strengths.`,
    ],
  },

  principle6: {
    title: 'Investigate Keywords and Prefixes',
    content: [
      `Sometimes platforms embed keywords, trigger words, or special behaviors. While it’s unclear whether Cascade AI fully leverages hidden prefixes yet, it's worth investigating.`,
      `For instance, snippets mention "windsurf" as a system prompt modifier. Testing different system prompt prefixes ("Windsurf mode", "Structured Mode", "Clarify mode") could reveal subtle model behavior shifts.`,
      `These hidden tricks can become valuable tools for more deeply aligning prompts with system defaults or training biases.`,
    ],
  },

  principle7: {
    title: 'Track Prompt Evolution',
    content: [
      `Successful prompt engineering requires iteration. Keep a running log or changelog of prompt refinements: what worked, what failed, what caused regressions.`,
      `Example logging fields:\n- Prompt version (e.g., v1, v2)\n- Changes made (e.g., added few-shot examples)\n- Observed behavior (better at clarifying questions, worse at handling edge cases)\n- Outcome assessment (ideal / acceptable / poor)`,
      `Tracking these details systematically builds institutional knowledge that greatly accelerates future prompt tuning efforts.`,
    ],
  },

      `Assuming general GPT-4 prompting advice applies 100% to Cascade without adaptation.`,
      `Refusing to adjust prompt styles even after noticing weaknesses.`,
      `Ignoring available documentation, community posts, or hints embedded in platform updates.`,
      `Not logging prompt evolution, forcing repeated rediscovery of solutions.`,

Outcome: Acceptable (85% correct coverage).`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Tailoring prompts for Cascade AI is a process of thoughtful application, adaptation, and refinement. While general prompt engineering principles provide a starting point, optimal results require testing, monitoring, and evolving your strategies based on platform-specific quirks and capabilities. 
By applying structure, tracking prompt changes, exploring hidden platform features, and adapting based on observed model behavior, you can transform Cascade AI into a highly reliable partner—one that not only generates content but collaborates intelligently with you over time. 
Prompt mastery is not a single event but a cumulative craft, and nowhere is that more true than when working with emerging AI platforms like Cascade.`,
