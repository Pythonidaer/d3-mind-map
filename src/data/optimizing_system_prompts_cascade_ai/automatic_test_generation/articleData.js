  introduction: `Automatic test generation is a powerful application of prompt engineering with Cascade AI. When AI generates code, ensuring that it also produces comprehensive, reliable tests significantly improves the quality, maintainability, and trustworthiness of that code. However, achieving high-quality test outputs requires careful prompt design. Instructing the model effectively means not only requesting tests, but also guiding the style, scope, data, and thought process behind the testing. This article explores the core strategies for prompting Cascade AI to generate automatic tests that meet professional standards.`,

  keyPrinciples: [
    {
      title: 'Explicit Test Instruction',
      content: [
        `The first and most fundamental step is to explicitly instruct the model to generate tests. Never assume the model will "know" to produce tests alongside code unless you state it clearly.`,
        `In your prompt, specify that tests are required, mention the language you want (e.g., Python, JavaScript), and, if relevant, request the use of a specific testing framework such as pytest, JUnit, or Jest.`,
        `Example: "Generate unit tests in Python using the pytest framework for the following function."`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Provide the Code',
      content: [
        `For Cascade AI to generate meaningful tests, the code that needs testing must either be included within the prompt or clearly referenced.`,
        `Providing the actual code allows the model to analyze inputs, outputs, conditions, and dependencies, all of which inform the construction of valid and relevant tests.`,
        `Even if referencing a shared resource, clarity is crucial: specify which methods, endpoints, or modules the tests should target.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Specify Test Types',
      content: [
        `There are multiple kinds of tests: unit tests, integration tests, system tests, positive tests (expected outcomes), and negative tests (error handling and invalid inputs).`,
        `Your prompt should indicate exactly which types of tests are needed. Without this, Cascade AI may focus too narrowly or broadly.`,
        `Example: "Generate both positive and negative unit tests for the following function, covering expected outputs and common failure conditions."`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Define Test Scope',
      content: [
        `Good tests are comprehensive but not bloated. You should guide the model on what scope the tests should cover.`,
        `Instruct the AI to test not just standard, expected input scenarios, but also edge cases (such as empty inputs, extremely large values, or null references) and invalid conditions.`,
        `By covering a wide range of scenarios, the AI ensures that the resulting code is robust against real-world usage and unexpected behavior.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Few-Shot Test Examples',
      content: [
        `As with any prompt engineering technique, providing examples dramatically increases success.`,
        `Include a few short examples of what well-written tests look like in the desired style and framework. Demonstrating the preferred structure, naming style, and assertion style primes Cascade AI to replicate that pattern reliably.`,
        `Example: Provide a pytest function that includes an assert statement, uses descriptive function names, and includes setup or teardown steps if appropriate.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Multi-Step Prompts',
      content: [
        `Complex tasks benefit from decomposition, and test generation is no different. You can improve output quality by asking Cascade AI to approach the task in multiple steps.`,
        `For instance, the prompt could first request an explanation of the function's purpose, then a brainstorming list of necessary test cases, and finally the generation of the actual test code.`,
        `This "plan-first, code-second" technique ensures deeper understanding and better coverage, rather than rushing directly into code generation.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Iterative Refinement',
      content: [
        `Even strong prompts sometimes produce incomplete or uneven test coverage. Iterative refinement means reviewing the generated tests critically, spotting weaknesses or gaps, and adjusting the prompt for the next attempt.`,
        `Example: If the model forgets to include edge cases, refine the next prompt to say, "Ensure at least one edge case (such as an empty list) is tested."`,
        `Prompt engineering for testing should be treated as an iterative, quality-driven cycle, not a single-shot task.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Prompt for Test Data',
      content: [
        `Tests are only as good as the data they use. A key part of the system prompt should be instructing the AI to generate appropriate and diverse test data.`,
        `Ask for a mixture of valid and invalid inputs, and where applicable, include realistic payloads like JSON objects, form submissions, or simulated API requests.`,
        `Example: "Generate a set of inputs including typical valid values, extreme boundary values, and intentionally invalid entries."`,
      ],
    },
  ],

    title: 'Benefits of Automatic Test Generation',
    content: [
      `Enhances the reliability and robustness of AI-generated code.`,
      `Saves developer time by accelerating the creation of comprehensive test suites.`,
      `Promotes better software design by encouraging modular, testable code.`,
      `Reduces the risk of regressions by validating expected and unexpected behaviors early.`,
      `Creates a feedback loop where the model improves future generations through clearer examples and scopes.`,
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Potential Challenges',
    content: [
      `Poorly scoped prompts may lead to bloated or redundant tests.`,
      `Insufficiently specific instructions can result in superficial or trivial tests.`,
      `Without critical review, automatically generated tests may miss important edge cases or failure paths.`,
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
    content: [
      `Assuming the AI will generate tests automatically without explicit instruction.`,
      `Requesting "tests" without defining the test type, framework, or scope.`,
      `Failing to include the code that needs testing or referencing it vaguely.`,
      `Accepting first-pass outputs without iterative review or improvement.`,
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Explicit Test Instruction',
      code: `// Good prompt
    "Generate unit tests for the following Python function using the pytest framework."
    
    // Bad prompt
    "Write tests." // Too vague!`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Providing Code in Prompt',
      code: `// Good
    "Here is the function to test:
    
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b"
    
    // Now generate unit tests for this function using pytest."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Specifying Test Types and Scope',
      code: `// Good prompt
    "Generate both positive and negative unit tests. Test for normal inputs, edge cases (e.g., very large numbers), and invalid inputs (e.g., passing strings instead of integers)."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Using Few-Shot Examples',
      code: `// Example test to prime the model
    def test_add_positive_numbers():
        assert add(2, 3) == 5`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Multi-Step Prompt Example',
      code: `// Multi-step approach
    "First, summarize what the following function does. Then, list at least five edge cases to test. Finally, generate pytest code covering those cases."`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Automatic test generation transforms Cascade AI from a code generator into a full-fledged development assistant. However, the quality of generated tests depends almost entirely on the quality of your prompt. By explicitly instructing the model, supplying necessary code, defining test types and scopes, using few-shot examples, and iteratively refining prompts based on output, you can ensure that Cascade AI produces reliable, thorough, and maintainable tests.
    Testing is not an afterthoughtâ€”it is a core discipline of software development. By embedding it deeply into your prompt strategy, you elevate both the code and the quality assurance processes that surround it, resulting in faster development cycles, better user experiences, and more stable systems.`,
