  introduction: `In human collaboration, asking clarifying questions before making assumptions is a sign of professionalism. The same should apply when working with AI. Cascade AI and other language models often produce better results when they are encouraged to ask questions before proceeding, especially in the presence of ambiguity, vague instructions, or missing information. Prompting the model to pause and clarify not only improves accuracy but fosters more efficient, interactive workflows. This article outlines how to structure system prompts and conversational cues to elicit thoughtful clarifying questions from AI systems.`,

  principle1: {
    title: 'Explicit Question Instruction',
    content: [
      `The most reliable way to encourage clarifying behavior is to explicitly tell the model to ask questions when it is uncertain.`,
      `Phrases like "If you are unsure, ask before continuing" or "Pause and ask me questions before proceeding with any assumptions" can be embedded directly into the prompt or system context.`,
      `AI models tend to optimize for completion—meaning they will try to fulfill any request unless told otherwise. Directly granting permission (or making it a requirement) to ask clarifying questions helps override that default behavior.`,
    ],
  },

  principle2: {
    title: 'Specify When to Ask',
    content: [
      `Clarifying behavior becomes even more powerful when scoped to specific conditions. You can guide the AI to ask questions when it encounters ambiguous phrasing, missing parameters, or conflicting instructions.`,
      `For example, a prompt might include: "If a variable name is not provided, ask me what it should be. If the purpose of the function is unclear, confirm it before writing code."`,
      `This conditional prompting helps the model decide *when* to ask, not just *if* it should ask.`,
    ],
  },

  principle3: {
    title: 'Role-Playing Prompt',
    content: [
      `Assigning the model a role like "a meticulous software engineer" or "a helpful assistant who always seeks to clarify intent" leverages role-based conditioning.`,
      `Models are surprisingly responsive to roles. By positioning the AI as a character who naturally values accuracy over speed, you can nudge its behavior toward interaction and confirmation.`,
      `Example prompt: "You are a careful developer who always confirms your understanding before writing implementation code."`,
    ],
  },

  principle4: {
    title: 'Few-Shot Dialogues',
    content: [
      `Few-shot prompting can include back-and-forth interactions where the model is shown how to pause and ask questions. These examples become templates for future behavior.`,
      `For instance:
User: "Build a dashboard that shows stats."
AI: "Can you clarify what kind of stats should be shown? Should the dashboard include graphs or just numbers?"`,
      `Just 2–3 examples can make the AI much more likely to behave this way going forward.`,
    ],
  },

  principle5: {
    title: 'Confirmation Prompts',
    content: [
      `Some actions warrant an extra confirmation layer. Deleting data, modifying permissions, deploying services, or performing irreversible operations all carry risk.`,
      `Your prompt can include instructions like: "Before generating destructive code or deleting data, ask me to confirm the action."`,
      `This preemptive safety net prevents the AI from producing harmful outputs in situations where a second opinion is warranted.`,
    ],
  },

  principle6: {
    title: 'Iterative Refinement',
    content: [
      `Sometimes your first prompt doesn’t fully trigger clarifying behavior. That’s normal.`,
      `Iterative refinement involves reviewing the AI's behavior and tweaking your prompt to better emphasize questioning.`,
      `For example, if the AI makes assumptions about variable names, refine your prompt to say: "You MUST ask me for variable names if they are not specified."`,
      `Just like in software testing, tight feedback loops are essential.`,
    ],
  },

  principle7: {
    title: 'Platform Config Exploration',
    content: [
      `Depending on the platform (e.g., Cascade AI), there may be settings to configure default behaviors. If Cascade supports system-level personas or safety parameters, you might be able to toggle a mode that favors questions over assumptions.`,
      `Exploring documentation, platform settings, or community guidelines may reveal underutilized capabilities for shaping how the AI responds across sessions.`,
    ],
  },

  benefits: {
    title: 'Benefits of Encouraging Clarifying Questions',
    content: [
      `Reduces misunderstandings and incorrect assumptions in AI-generated outputs.`,
      `Prevents time wasted on inaccurate completions or code generation.`,
      `Encourages an interactive, feedback-driven workflow with the AI.`,
      `Makes outputs safer, especially in sensitive domains like data manipulation or deployment.`,
      `Builds confidence that the model understands the request before proceeding.`,
    ],
  },

  cons: {
    title: 'Potential Challenges',
    content: [
      `May slightly increase back-and-forth time in high-velocity environments.`,
      `Requires more detailed prompt writing and example design.`,
      `If overused, questions may become redundant or break flow.`,
    ],
  },

  antiPatterns: {
    title: 'Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
    content: [
      `Assuming the model will ask questions without being explicitly told to.`,
      `Writing vague prompts and expecting the model to fill in all missing context.`,
      `Giving contradictory or overloaded instructions that suppress interaction.`,
      `Asking for irreversible actions (like deletions) without requiring confirmation.`,
    ],
  },

  codeExamples: [
    {
      title: 'Explicit Clarification Instruction',
      code: `// Prompt example
"If you are unsure about any part of the request, ask me a clarifying question before proceeding."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Role-Playing as a Cautious Developer',
      code: `// Role-based prompt
"You are a meticulous software engineer who always confirms your understanding of the requirements before writing any code."`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Few-Shot Dialogue Example',
      code: `// Back-and-forth example
User: "Create a script for uploading data."
AI: "Can you clarify what kind of data? Are we uploading to a local directory or a cloud service like S3?"`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Confirmation for Risky Actions',
      code: `// Confirmation prompt
"Before writing any code that deletes files or data, ask for confirmation."`,
    },
  ],

  conclusion: `Encouraging Cascade AI to ask clarifying questions isn’t just a productivity tactic—it’s a safety, accuracy, and quality enhancement. When used properly, this approach transforms your interaction from a one-way instruction to a collaborative dialogue. Prompt engineering is about shaping AI behavior, and one of the most powerful behaviors to encourage is thoughtful clarification. With explicit instructions, examples, roles, and iterative refinement, you can reliably steer the AI to ask smart, context-aware questions that prevent missteps and improve final results.`,
