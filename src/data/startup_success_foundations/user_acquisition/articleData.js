    conclusion: `User acquisition is not a one-time project—it’s a continuous learning process. Start by validating one channel well, then scale into others as you learn where your users come from and what drives them to act. Track what works, talk to users constantly, and treat every strategy as an experiment. The startups that grow fastest aren't the ones with the biggest budgets—they’re the ones that understand and serve their audience best.`
