    introduction: `Investors don’t fund ideas—they fund traction, teams, and momentum. To secure investment and scale confidently, startups need to understand the metrics that matter most. From early-stage usage patterns to unit economics and market potential, metrics provide evidence that a startup is viable, scalable, and ready for funding. This article details the key metrics investors evaluate, how to track them, what milestones matter for each funding stage, and which mistakes to avoid.`,

        `Metrics should demonstrate traction, not vanity. Focus on active usage, engagement, and revenue—not likes or downloads.`,
        `Readiness varies by funding stage: Pre-seed needs vision and validation; Seed needs retention and early revenue; Series A needs growth and defensibility.`,
        `Financial metrics must be paired with narrative: metrics explain *what’s working*, but your vision explains *why it matters*.`,
        `Startups that understand their unit economics early are more likely to scale sustainably.`,
        `Market size, retention, and burn rate aren’t just investor KPIs—they help founders plan responsibly.`

      content: [
        `**MRR & Growth Rates:** Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is critical for SaaS startups. Even $10K–$20K MRR at Seed stage can show promise if you're growing 10–25% MoM.`,
        `**Network Effects:** Does your product become more valuable as more users join? Referral loops, UGC, or collaborative tools (like Slack or Dropbox) increase growth defensibility.`

      title: 'Engagement & Retention: Depth Matters',
      content: [
        `**DAU/MAU Ratios:** A high DAU/MAU ratio (20%–30%+) signals sticky engagement. For example, a calendar app used daily shows stronger retention than one used monthly.`,
        `**Feature Usage:** Which features get used? Investors want to see users relying on the product’s core value proposition. Use metrics like time-in-feature, repeat usage, or cohort activity to quantify this.`

      title: 'Unit Economics: Sustainability Behind Growth',
      content: [
        `**CAC vs. LTV:** Customer Acquisition Cost should be significantly lower than Customer Lifetime Value. A 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio is a benchmark. This metric proves that your marketing isn’t just buying short-term users.`,
        `**Burn Rate & Runway:** Investors assess how long you can survive without raising again. Burn rate (monthly spend) and runway (months of cash left) are essential metrics in pitch decks.`

        `**TAM/SAM/SOM:** Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Addressable Market, and Serviceable Obtainable Market are tiers that describe market scope. For example, if TAM is $10B but SOM is $250M, you’re signaling achievable focus.`,

        `**Seed Stage:** Investors want to see a working product, validated use case, early traction (10–30% MoM growth), and strong user feedback. $20K–$100K MRR is often a good range, or 25K+ active users in consumer apps.`,
        `**Series A:** At this stage, you're expected to show scale. Investors look for $200K+ MRR or 500K+ DAUs, 12+ months of cohort retention, repeatable acquisition channels, and strong unit economics. Vision matters less than numbers.`

    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Funding Anti-Patterns to Avoid',
      content: [
        `**Vanity Metrics:** Total app downloads, site visits, or likes are easy to inflate and rarely prove user value. Focus instead on retention, LTV, or usage depth.`,
        `**Growth Without Fit:** Driving signups through ads or PR without achieving true product-market fit leads to churn. You’ll spend more and grow less.`,
        `**No Unit Economics:** If you don’t know how much it costs to acquire and retain a user, investors will view your model as unstable—even if you're growing.`

        title: 'TAM/SAM/SOM Example (Commented)',
        code:
  `// TAM: Global online education = $200B
  // SAM: English-speaking digital courses = $80B
  // SOM: Targeting career switchers in tech = $600M`

      {
        title: 'Sample Burn Rate & Runway Calculation',
        code:
  `const monthlyBurn = 25000; // expenses - revenue
  const cashOnHand = 300000;
  const runwayMonths = cashOnHand / monthlyBurn; // 12 months runway`
      }
    ],
  
    conclusion: `Numbers don’t lie—but they can mislead if used carelessly. Strong metrics show investors that you’re not just dreaming—you’re executing. Focus on traction, retention, sustainable growth, and unit economics, then tie those numbers to a compelling story about the problem you're solving and the size of the opportunity ahead. Founders who track metrics early don’t just fundraise better—they build smarter businesses from day one.`
