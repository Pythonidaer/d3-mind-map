This article outlines how to strategically align branding with UI design to build a startup that feels polished, trustworthy, and coherent from day one.`,

        `**Logo Design:** A strong logo communicates the essence of your brand in a single image. It should be legible at all sizes, versatile across formats, and distinct enough to stand out.`,
        `**Color Palette:** Choose 1–2 primary brand colors, 2–3 supporting tones, and clear contrast colors. Use color psychology to reinforce your brand’s tone (e.g., blue for trust, green for growth).`,
        `**Typography:** Select heading and body fonts that are legible and expressive of your brand’s personality. Keep font choices consistent across your website, marketing, and product UI.`

Design systems and UI branding aren't fluff—they're strategic investments in how the world sees and uses your startup.`
