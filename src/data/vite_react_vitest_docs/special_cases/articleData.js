    introduction: `Beyond tutorials and API references lie the messy, ambiguous, and evolving edge cases of documentation. These “special documentation scenarios” are often where projects break down—or where seasoned developers spend most of their time searching for clarity.
  
  This section dives into overlooked but essential types of documentation: tracking dependencies and their rationale, documenting AI-generated code, and explaining what your system *doesn’t* support. These practices make your documentation stronger, more transparent, and more sustainable in real-world use.`,

      title: "What Makes These Scenarios 'Special'",
      content: [
        "They often lack standardized formats or expectations—yet developers still rely on them.",
        "They evolve quickly due to technology trends (e.g., AI tooling, JS ecosystem churn).",
        "They’re easy to omit but can cause major confusion, misuse, or legal risk when undocumented.",
        "They require thoughtful communication of boundaries, trade-offs, and uncertainty."

      title: "Why Covering These Scenarios Adds Long-Term Value",
      content: [
        "Improves maintainability by documenting why tools were chosen, not just that they exist.",
        "Reduces miscommunication and debugging time around edge cases and limitations.",
        "Promotes transparency around AI usage and prevents risky code from entering production.",
        "Clarifies the system’s scope, which improves decision-making and developer expectations.",
        "Creates trust with users, contributors, and external stakeholders by showing intentionality and honesty."

    deepDive_doc_dependencies: {
      title: "Documenting Code Dependencies",
      content: [
        "Most projects rely on dozens (or hundreds) of third-party packages. Listing these in `package.json` isn’t enough—developers need to understand what each dependency does, why it was chosen, and what happens if it changes.",
        "**Version & Usage Notes**: Document exact versions of key packages and what they’re used for. Example: 'Using Zod v3.20 for runtime schema validation. Chosen over Yup for bundle size and TypeScript support.'",
        "**Why Each Dependency Matters**: Explain *why* a dependency is necessary, especially for critical, non-obvious packages. Was it added for performance, DX, compatibility, etc.? Link to its docs and note any required setup.",
        "**Update Risks & Compatibility**: Call out dependencies with major version risks, frequent churn, or compatibility issues. If removing one would break tests or force rewrites, document that cost."
      ]

    deepDive_ai_code: {
      title: "AI-Generated Code",
      content: [
        "As AI-generated code becomes more common, documenting its origin and safety becomes essential. Treat AI like a junior developer: helpful, but in need of supervision.",
        "**Prompt Documentation**: Save the prompt (or a summary of it) that generated a particular block of code. Include it as a comment, or link to a discussion. This provides context for why the AI suggested that approach.",
        "**Human Review Notes**: After generating code, document what was changed. For example: 'Added input sanitization and swapped out async/await for Promises to fix race conditions.' This transparency helps future reviewers understand intent and limitations.",
        "**Originality & Licensing**: Note if the AI used was subject to copyright constraints (e.g., trained on GPL code) or if the generated code might require human oversight for licensing. This is especially important for open-source projects or companies under legal scrutiny."
      ]

    deepDive_edge_docs: {
      title: "Limitations and Edge Case Behavior",
      content: [
        "Many bugs stem not from code errors, but from undocumented boundaries or hidden assumptions. This section helps you make those limits visible and understandable.",
        "**Known Bugs & Constraints**: Be honest about what doesn’t work. Examples: 'Only tested in Chromium-based browsers', 'Fails if config is missing environment variable X', or 'Does not work when executed concurrently on Windows'.",
        "**Document Unexpected Behavior**: If your system behaves strangely in certain inputs (e.g., returns null instead of throwing), document that explicitly—even if it’s 'by design'. These notes prevent wasted debugging time.",
        "**Unsupported Use Cases**: Write out what your system *isn’t* meant to do. Example: 'This tool does not handle circular dependencies. For that, use Rollup.' This prevents misalignment and frustrated users."
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion: `Special documentation scenarios aren’t just edge cases—they’re opportunities to make your documentation truly robust. By documenting dependencies, AI-assisted code, and boundaries of your system, you reduce confusion, improve trust, and prevent future mistakes.
  
  These scenarios may feel optional, but they’re often the first things developers look for when troubleshooting. Don’t leave them to chance. By addressing the obscure, the awkward, and the AI-assisted, your documentation becomes a beacon—not just a manual.
  
  Strong documentation doesn’t only say what your code *does*. It explains what it *doesn’t*, where it came from, and what it depends on to survive.`,
