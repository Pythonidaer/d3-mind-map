    introduction: `Writing documentation isn’t just about explaining what your system does—it’s about making that explanation useful tomorrow, six months from now, and even after team members leave or switch roles. This section explores strategies that make documentation maintainable, emphasizing techniques suited for solo developers and small teams who may not have dedicated technical writers.
  
  Documentation for maintainability addresses the ongoing lifecycle of your knowledge base: how it grows, how it evolves, and how it avoids becoming stale or inaccurate. This includes approaches to documenting decisions, communicating code intent, and staying organized as the system changes.`,

      content: [
        "Good documentation is not just accurate—it’s maintainable. It survives changes in architecture, team size, or project direction.",
        "Maintainable documentation should be easy to locate, easy to update, and closely aligned with the source of truth (usually your codebase).",
        "These practices help reduce the long-term cost of maintenance while improving developer confidence and code quality."

        "Reduces technical debt and wasted effort caused by outdated or inconsistent documentation.",
        "Speeds up onboarding and debugging by providing durable context over time.",
        "Improves long-term productivity, especially in environments with limited staff or high turnover.",
        "Encourages documentation ownership as part of everyday development, rather than a one-time task."

      title: "Solo Developer Strategies",
      content: [
        "When you're the only one working on a codebase, documentation might feel unnecessary—but the future you will thank the present you. Memory fades, features grow, and systems evolve in complexity.",
        "**Markdown in Repository**: Keep documentation inside the repo so that it’s version-controlled alongside code. Tools like GitHub automatically render Markdown, making it easy to preview and link. Create a `docs/` folder, or simply maintain `.md` files in relevant module directories.",
        "**Storytelling Code**: Use self-explanatory variable and function names. If the logic is complex or breaks conventions, comment *why*, not just *what*. For example:\n\n\`\`\`js\n// We use setTimeout here instead of debounce() to prevent double-triggers on slow networks\nsetTimeout(triggerUpload, 150);\n\`\`\`\n",
        "**Task & Idea Tracking**: Use a flat `NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`, or even Notion to write down open questions, bugs to fix later, and architecture choices. Treat it like a dev diary. This helps you avoid forgetting key logic, decisions, or to-dos as the project grows."

    deepDive_design_rationale: {
      title: "Design Rationale",
      content: [
        "Design rationale explains *why* the code is structured the way it is. Without this, future developers (including yourself) may second-guess decisions, rewrite working logic, or break assumptions.",
        "**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: ADRs are short, timestamped documents that log technical decisions, what options were considered, and the consequences of each. They live in a directory like `/docs/adr/` and follow a simple template: context → decision → status → consequences.",
        "**Explain Tradeoffs**: If your solution has caveats, say so. For example, 'We chose in-memory caching here to reduce latency, but it will break in a distributed environment.' This makes it clear what the trade-off is and when to re-evaluate.",
        "**State Non-Goals**: Just as important as what your code does is what it *doesn’t* do. Clarifying non-goals prevents feature creep, misaligned assumptions, and misunderstandings. For example, 'This library is not designed for streaming large files—it is optimized for small payloads only.'"
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_code_intent: {
      title: "Code Intent & Dependencies",
      content: [
        "Maintainable documentation should surface the purpose, dependencies, and modifiability of each major part of your code. This is especially important in complex, modular systems.",
        "**Function-Level Intent**: Explain why a function exists and what its role is in the bigger picture. Use comments and docstrings for deeper insight. For example:\n\n\`\`\`js\n// Converts external API responses into internal models used by our UI\nfunction transformUserData(rawData) {\n  ...\n}\n\`\`\`",
        "**Modifiability & Impact**: For sensitive parts of the codebase, explain what *not* to change and why. If a function is tightly coupled to a legacy system or caching layer, make that known in the docs. Also, list which modules rely on which interfaces, so other developers can anticipate side effects.",
        "**Dependencies & Versions**: Document third-party libraries with purpose, version, and critical usage notes. For example:\n\n- `Zod v3.20` – used for form schema validation. Alternatives considered: Yup, Joi. Reason for Zod: TypeScript support and bundle size.\n- `classnames` – dynamically adds CSS class strings. Required for conditional rendering in Tailwind.\n\nKnowing what a dependency is *for* is as important as knowing *that* it's there."
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion: `Maintainable documentation is what separates projects that scale gracefully from those that become brittle and opaque. Whether you're a solo developer or a small team, the best investment you can make is not in documenting *everything*, but in documenting what matters: the decisions, intent, and dependencies that are hard to rediscover later.
  
  By using Markdown in the repo, documenting trade-offs, writing Architecture Decision Records, and describing modifiability clearly, you enable future collaborators to contribute with confidence and context. And by keeping dependencies well-explained, your system becomes easier to audit, update, or refactor without fear.
  
  Documentation that is easy to update, well-organized, and close to the codebase will always outlive one-time writeups or wikis that fall out of sync. Think of your documentation not as an archive, but as a living map that evolves with the terrain.`
