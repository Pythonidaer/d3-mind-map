    introduction: `Automation is one of the most effective ways to keep developer documentation consistent, current, and low-friction. In modern JavaScript stacks—especially those using Vite, React, and Vitest—the opportunity to generate documentation from code, tests, and even AI models enables developers to scale their documentation efforts without overwhelming manual effort.
  
  This section explores how tools like JSDoc, Typedoc, test suites, and AI integrations can generate useful documentation from your existing workflows. It emphasizes the balance between automation and human oversight and encourages the use of these tools as scaffolding—not substitutes—for clarity and intent.`,

      title: "Principles of Documentation Automation",
      content: [
        "Automated documentation should reflect the actual codebase. It must be updated as the code changes and avoid falling out of sync.",
        "Tools should reduce, not increase, friction for developers writing or consuming documentation.",
        "Automation does not replace thoughtful explanation or editorial review—it enhances your foundation and helps scale documentation coverage."

    benefits: {
      title: "Benefits of Automating Documentation",
      content: [
        "Keeps documentation up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.",
        "Improves accuracy and consistency across multiple files or contributors.",
        "Reduces context-switching by embedding documentation in the same environment as code and tests.",
        "Enables reference docs, onboarding guides, or component libraries to be generated directly from source code.",
        "Supports larger teams or fast-changing codebases where manual documentation quickly becomes outdated."

    deepDive_jsdoc_typedoc: {
      title: "JSDoc and Typedoc",
      content: [
        "JSDoc and Typedoc are industry-standard tools for generating documentation from inline comments. They encourage writing documentation *close to the code* using structured syntax that can be parsed into readable output.",
        "**Inline Comments**: Use JSDoc-style annotations such as `@param`, `@returns`, and `@example` to describe function arguments, return values, and usage. These annotations can be added above any JavaScript or TypeScript function.",
        "**HTML & Markdown Output**: JSDoc and Typedoc can be configured to generate static websites or Markdown files. These can be deployed as developer portals or imported into Docusaurus, VitePress, or GitHub Pages. Themes like `better-docs` provide enhanced layouts, live previews, and component-specific formatting for React projects.",
        "**Typedoc for TypeScript**: Typedoc reads directly from TypeScript declarations and offers deeper integration with type information than JSDoc. It is ideal for modern TS-first codebases, especially component libraries or SDKs where static typing improves clarity."
      ]
    },
  
    deepDive_tests_docs: {
      title: "Tests as Living Documentation",
      content: [
        "Your test suite can be one of the most up-to-date sources of truth about how your code behaves—especially when written with clarity in mind. Tests written using behavior-driven development (BDD) principles often read like specifications.",
        "**Descriptive Test Names**: Avoid meaningless names like \`test('should work')\`. Instead, describe behavior in full: \`test('returns null if user session is missing')\`. A well-named test case doubles as inline documentation for developers scanning the test suite.",
        "**TDD and Spec Style**: In Test-Driven Development (TDD), tests are written before implementation. These serve as specs that define how the system *should* behave. When using libraries like Vitest or Jest, descriptive `describe()` and `it()` blocks can narrate the feature’s intention clearly.",
        "**Testdoc and Generators**: Tools like `testdoc` (for Jest, Mocha, or Vitest) parse test files and generate Markdown documents based on the names and structure of your test suites. These documents can be auto-generated into READMEs or developer portals, offering insight into behavior without reading the code directly."
      ]

    deepDive_ai_assistance: {
      title: "AI-Powered Documentation Assistance",
      content: [
        "AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or CodiumAI can assist with drafting, formatting, and summarizing documentation based on your codebase. These tools should not be relied on to *replace* developer-authored documentation but can help jumpstart or fill gaps quickly.",
        "**Code Summarization**: AI can read code and output summaries of what a module or function does. This can be useful when dealing with legacy code or when onboarding new contributors. Tools integrated into IDEs (e.g., Copilot) can offer these summaries inline.",
        "**Markdown Drafts**: AI can generate starting points for documentation sections, such as 'Usage', 'Installation', or even templated function explanations. These drafts should always be manually refined to ensure they reflect real-world usage, edge cases, and team standards.",
        "**Human Review Required**: AI-generated docs can hallucinate APIs, omit key context, or misinterpret logic. Always treat AI outputs as a starting point—not the final product. Pair AI assistance with robust review workflows (e.g., GitHub PRs or pair writing) to ensure quality and consistency."
      ]
    },
  
    conclusion: `Automated documentation tools are not a shortcut—they're a support system. They remove repetitive grunt work, keep code and docs in sync, and make large projects more maintainable over time. But they do not replace thoughtful writing, architectural context, or nuanced examples.
  
  The strongest documentation ecosystems combine automation with intentional authorship. Use JSDoc or Typedoc to cover your functions. Use tests as executable specs. Let AI generate helpful scaffolding. Then, refine and review with human eyes.
  
  When your documentation updates automatically, explains itself through tests, and is enriched with AI-suggested summaries, your development process becomes faster, more sustainable, and more empowering for your team.`
