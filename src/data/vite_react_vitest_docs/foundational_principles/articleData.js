    introduction: `The foundational principles of great developer documentation are rooted in clarity, consistency, and scalability. Without these, even the most well-intentioned documentation can become confusing, outdated, or unusable. In the context of modern frontend projects—especially those using Vite, React, and Vitest—good documentation ensures that knowledge is captured, shared, and maintained across changing team members and codebases.
  
  This section breaks down best practices for writing clear and concise documentation, establishing a consistent structure, and building systems that scale as your project grows. These principles are essential whether you're a solo developer maintaining your own notes or a team contributing to a large public knowledge base.`,

      content: [
        "Documentation must be easy to read, easy to follow, and easy to scale. These goals require deliberate effort.",
        "You should write with the reader’s perspective in mind—not just what you know, but what they need to know and how they’ll find it.",
        "Foundational principles apply universally across documentation types: whether you're writing a README, an API reference, or an onboarding guide, these principles ensure that your work is useful to others."

        "Clarity prevents confusion and misinterpretation.",
        "Consistency reduces cognitive load and accelerates comprehension.",
        "Scalability ensures your documentation won’t collapse under the weight of future growth or team complexity.",

      title: "Clarity & Conciseness",
      content: [
        "Clear and concise documentation is about making every word count without sacrificing understanding. Developers don’t want novels—they want actionable explanations.",
        "This principle encourages a focus on direct, simple language. For example, instead of saying, 'This module facilitates the asynchronous handling of user interaction events,' you could say, 'This module tracks user clicks and updates the UI without reloading the page.'",
        "Being concise means avoiding unnecessary filler and overly formal phrasing. You don’t need to use complex academic grammar to sound intelligent—clarity is intelligence."

      content: [
        "**Clear**: Say exactly what you mean using unambiguous language. Avoid passive voice and complicated constructions.",
        "**Concise**: Eliminate redundant words and streamline explanations. Developers appreciate brevity.",
        "**Concrete**: Back up abstract descriptions with specific, real-world examples—especially code samples.",
        "**Correct**: Verify every statement and update docs to match the latest implementation. Outdated docs are dangerous.",
        "**Coherent**: Organize content logically. Group related information and maintain consistent structure within sections.",
        "**Complete**: Ensure that the reader has all necessary context. Don’t assume prior knowledge unless it’s stated in the prerequisites.",
        "**Courteous**: Write respectfully and professionally. A neutral, constructive tone improves trust and usability."

    deepDive_concrete_examples: {
      title: "Use Concrete Examples",
      content: [
        "Examples transform abstract descriptions into understandable use cases. They help readers immediately grasp the relevance of what’s being described.",
        "Instead of: 'You can customize the build process,' write: 'To customize the build, add a plugin to `vite.config.js`, like `vite-plugin-svgr` for SVG imports.'",
        "Code samples are the best examples—ensure they are tested and up to date. If you're explaining a config, include a real snippet. If you're documenting a function, show how it's used in context."

      title: "Avoid Jargon",
      content: [
        "While developers are technical readers, not everyone shares the same level of experience or background.",
        "Avoid niche acronyms, tool-specific lingo, or internally coined terms unless clearly defined. For example, instead of 'hydration,' you could say 'client re-renders the static HTML with interactivity after load.'",
        "If a technical term is important, define it once, then use it consistently. Overusing jargon without explanation alienates new contributors and leads to knowledge silos."

        "Documentation benefits from predictable structure. Readers should know where to find things and what to expect in each section.",
        "Consistency builds trust. If one tutorial uses H2 for steps and another switches between H3 and bullet lists, it creates confusion.",
        "Establish shared formatting rules and enforce them with linters (e.g., Markdownlint). Use consistent heading levels, code block formatting, link syntax, and callout styles."

        "Each template should include boilerplate sections, such as 'Overview', 'Usage', 'Installation', 'Examples', and 'FAQ'. This makes it easier for others to contribute and follow best practices without reinventing the wheel."

        "Good headings help both humans and machines (like screen readers and search engines) understand the document’s structure.",
