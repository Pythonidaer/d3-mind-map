    introduction: `Launching and handing off a WordPress site involves far more than clicking a "publish" button. This phase requires strategic workflows, final validation, user empowerment, and maintenance planning. Done right, it ensures a seamless transition from development to production, safeguards performance and security, and arms clients with the tools to confidently manage their own site. This article breaks down the key steps, responsibilities, and best practices associated with staging, deploying, and maintaining a successful WordPress launch.`,

    conclusion: `A successful WordPress handoff goes beyond technical deployment. It's a comprehensive transfer of responsibility — from the developer or agency to the client. By following a structured process that includes staging workflows, checklists, documentation, and ongoing support strategies, you ensure the client receives not only a functioning website, but one they can understand, trust, and grow with. Remember, a confident client is your best testimonial.`
