    conclusion:
      "Each WordPress release isn’t just a software update — it represents a philosophical stance on what the web should be: open, accessible, extensible, and easy to publish on. From the introduction of permalinks and themes to modern AI-ready workflows and full-site control, WordPress has consistently evolved while staying true to its roots. Understanding its version history reveals not just how it grew — but why it continues to matter.",
