    introduction: `Migrating and backing up WordPress websites is critical to maintaining site integrity, minimizing downtime, and ensuring data recovery in emergencies. Whether you're moving to a new host, launching from staging to production, or preparing for failure recovery, understanding how to execute migrations and backups properly is an essential skill.`,

    conclusion: `WordPress migration and backup strategies are vital for both developers and business owners. Whether transitioning hosts or safeguarding against failure, automation tools, staging environments, and off-site backups are essential. With a blend of best practices and smart tooling, you can ensure your site remains safe, flexible, and future-proof.`
