        "**WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) offers a global standard for accessible design. WordPress developers should strive for Level AA compliance, covering visual contrast, keyboard navigation, and more.",
        "**Semantic HTML** enhances accessibility by providing meaning to content structure, making it easier for screen readers to interpret.",
        "**ARIA attributes** help when HTML alone cannot convey state or roles (e.g., `aria-expanded` on toggle buttons). However, ARIA should never be a substitute for semantic HTML.",

        "**CSS media queries** let developers apply specific styling rules at different breakpoints (`min-width` or `max-width`).",
        "**Flexbox and CSS Grid** provide layout control that adapts to content and viewport without requiring rigid breakpoints.",

      title: 'Common Accessibility & Responsive Pitfalls',
      content: [
        "**Theme Inconsistency**: Some themes advertised as responsive do not handle all breakpoints well, leading to awkward layouts on tablets or ultra-wide monitors.",
        "**Plugin Violations**: Many plugins build custom interfaces without labeling inputs, buttons, or modal states, causing issues for screen reader users.",
        "**Overcomplication**: Adding complex animations, carousels, and conditional layouts can confuse users, especially those relying on assistive tech or slower devices.",

    conclusion:
      "Accessibility and responsiveness are not optional—they are foundational to building usable, inclusive, and performant WordPress sites. Developers and designers should treat these as core design values, not afterthoughts. As tools like Gutenberg and theme.json evolve, the opportunity to enforce consistent standards at scale becomes even greater. By embracing these principles, your WordPress site becomes better for everyone: faster, clearer, easier to navigate, and accessible across devices and user abilities.",
