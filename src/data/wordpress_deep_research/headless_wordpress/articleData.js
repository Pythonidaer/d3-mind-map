    introduction: `Headless WordPress represents a significant architectural shift that separates content management (WordPress backend) from presentation (frontend frameworks like React or Vue). This decoupled model unlocks new performance gains, flexibility, and developer freedom. Below is a detailed exploration of this model, including REST and GraphQL APIs, common use cases, trade-offs, and examples of implementation.`,

      content: [
        '**Decoupling**: The frontend is separated from WordPress, which acts purely as a content API.',
        '**API-Centric**: All content is delivered via the REST API or GraphQL.',
        '**Technology Agnostic Frontend**: Developers can use React, Vue, Svelte, or static site generators.',

        '**Performance Gains** from static site generation and client-side rendering.',
        '**Frontend Flexibility** allowing the use of modern frameworks and toolchains.',
        '**Multi-Platform Publishing**, where the same WordPress backend serves web, mobile, or IoT.',
        '**Better Scalability**, as the frontend can be globally deployed via CDNs like Vercel or Netlify.',
        '**Tight Developer Control** over rendering, state, and performance optimization.',

      content: [
        '**Increased Complexity** in setup, authentication, and routing.',
        '**Loss of WordPress Plugins** that render HTML or rely on server-side rendering.',
        '**No Native Previews** for drafts and scheduled posts — requires custom logic.',
        '**Split Hosting & Deployment**, often needing separate infrastructure for backend and frontend.',

    antiPatterns: {
      title: 'Common Anti-Patterns in Headless WordPress',
      content: [
        'Using WordPress as both backend and frontend — defeats the purpose of headless.',
        'Querying APIs inefficiently, such as making multiple requests for data that could be queried once.',
        'Overengineering with GraphQL when REST would suffice for small projects.',
        'Forgetting to secure your endpoints — public APIs without JWT/OAuth can leak private content.',

    deepDive_architecture: {
      title: 'Decoupled Architecture',
      content: [
        'Headless WordPress follows a **decoupled architecture** where the backend (WordPress) handles content creation, storage, and management, while the frontend is built separately using modern JavaScript libraries or static site generators.',
        'This allows you to completely separate content logic from visual rendering logic.',
      ],
    },
  
    deepDive_rest_api: {
      title: 'REST API Integration',
      content: [
        'The **WordPress REST API** exposes endpoints at `/wp-json/wp/v2/...` for accessing posts, pages, media, and users in JSON format.',
        'You can fetch these endpoints from any JavaScript app, mobile app, or static site generator.',
        'Endpoints can be extended or created manually to expose custom post types and fields.',
      ],
    },
  
    deepDive_graphql: {
      title: 'Using WPGraphQL',
      content: [
        '**WPGraphQL** is a plugin that adds a single GraphQL endpoint to your WordPress site.',
        'GraphQL allows you to request only the fields you need, reducing overfetching and enabling nested queries for complex content structures.',
        'It integrates well with **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**, enabling precise and performant queries.',

    deepDive_frontend: {
      title: 'React / Next.js and Frontend Frameworks',
      content: [
        'You can build the frontend in React, Vue, Svelte, or even with static site generators like Gatsby or Astro.',
        'Next.js is especially popular for WordPress headless setups, thanks to its native support for SSG (Static Site Generation), SSR (Server-Side Rendering), and API routes.',
        'React apps can fetch WordPress data using `fetch`, `axios`, or SWR for client-side rendering, or use `getStaticProps` for build-time rendering.',

    deepDive_jamstack: {
      title: 'JAMstack & Headless WordPress',
      content: [
        '**JAMstack** stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.',
        'Headless WordPress fits perfectly into this paradigm by providing an API backend that feeds pre-rendered or client-rendered pages.',

    conclusion: `Headless WordPress empowers developers to craft lightning-fast, scalable, and modern frontends while still benefiting from WordPress's editorial and content management strengths. By leveraging the REST API or GraphQL, developers can build JAMstack-friendly websites using the frontend framework of their choice. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of complexity, requiring careful architectural planning, secure authentication, and custom solutions for previewing, search, and interactivity. For developers comfortable in both WordPress and modern JavaScript, headless WordPress presents a powerful and future-facing solution.`,
