      "WordPress security is not a single switch you flip—it's a discipline that involves layered defense, vigilance, and smart defaults. By keeping your system updated, minimizing access, monitoring your site, and preparing for the worst with backups, you make your WordPress installation resilient against a wide array of threats. These practices should be standard not just for security teams, but for every developer and site administrator managing WordPress in 2025 and beyond.",
