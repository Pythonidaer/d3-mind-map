    introduction:
      "The frontend development stack encompasses all the core technologies, libraries, tools, and workflows used to build the visual and interactive part of a website. In the context of WordPress, modern frontend stacks are increasingly relevant — from classic theme development to building custom Gutenberg blocks and full-fledged headless applications using React or Vue. This article dives into each layer of the stack, explaining its components, purpose, and its specific relationship to WordPress development in 2025.",
