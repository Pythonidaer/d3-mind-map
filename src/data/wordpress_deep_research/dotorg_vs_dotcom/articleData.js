      'The distinction between WordPress.org and WordPress.com is one of the most important concepts for anyone looking to build a website with WordPress. While both options use the same underlying WordPress software, they serve very different audiences and offer very different experiences. This article explores the differences in hosting, control, customization, cost, scalability, and support, and provides context for choosing the best platform for your needs.',

    conclusion:
      'The choice between WordPress.org and WordPress.com depends on your technical confidence, desired level of control, and specific website goals. WordPress.org is the platform of choice for developers, businesses, and anyone needing full customization and data control. It does require more responsibility but offers unlimited flexibility. WordPress.com, in contrast, provides an easy entry point with low maintenance overhead, perfect for users who want to focus on content and not infrastructure. By understanding the core differences and evaluating your needs upfront, you can choose the right platform and grow without painful migration later.',
