    introduction:
      "Visual editors in WordPress provide a powerful, intuitive way to build websites without writing code. From the native Gutenberg block editor to third-party builders like Elementor and Divi, users can visually compose pages using drag-and-drop functionality, reusable blocks, and custom layouts. These tools have redefined how themes are built, customized, and delivered — especially as Full Site Editing becomes the new norm. This article explores the evolution of visual editors, the pros and cons of each, and implementation insights for developers and designers alike.",

    conclusion:
      "Visual editors have revolutionized how users build WordPress websites, lowering the barrier to entry and enabling rapid development workflows. Tools like Elementor provide expansive design freedom, while Gutenberg aims for a standardized native experience with future-focused features like Full Site Editing. Each visual editor comes with trade-offs, especially in terms of performance, portability, and extensibility. For developers, selecting the right editor involves understanding project needs, content ownership expectations, and performance goals. Whether you're creating a simple site or a dynamic custom theme, mastering visual editors is crucial in modern WordPress development."
